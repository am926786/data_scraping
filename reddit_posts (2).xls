Believe me I don't feel great about it. I feel even less about this sub as I thought we were here to make plays. $30K really isn't shit.. I know that buys a lot of bublicious vape juice for you spare bedroom dwellers but chill.

I thought about throwing in another 5K this week but I honestly want to show the lads and laddets here that cumbacks are still possible. I had fellow degens messaging me that they too lost some coin that day and how torn they are, how they feel so lost and I cant blame them. Anyway I will be posting weekly updates or Ad Hoc. As my previous post stated I was originally trying to take a portion of my new car money and flip it. While I can still go buy the car it has not yet come out. Its a 2025 model refresh and at over $100k I thought it would be nice if the market paid for it. Anyways. The dual mandate here is first, recover my losses and second, show to the fellow degens that you can come back from the low.

"GOOGLE: The Real Leader In AI, Robotics and Self Driving ",203,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g1awnr/google_the_real_leader_in_ai_robotics_and_self/,152,1728656371.0,"This is a follow up  post to my analysis of TESLA VS WAYMO. 


Right now OpenAI is the clear leader when it comes to developing AI. Everyone else is playing catch up, however there's one company that doesn't get enough credit - GOOGLE. 


Google is the one that actually did most of the groundbreaking work in AI. They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. 


You must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? 


The reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. 

Google had something called ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS.""  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. 

AI research and development was a part of it.

In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.

DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.


The Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).


Now going back to ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS"" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  ""Project Moonshots"" into ""X COMPANY"".

Yes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. 

This is what X Company does -

X's mission is to invent and launch ""moonshot"" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.

 A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. 

Work at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and ""Captain of Moonshots"".

The lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.


SELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. 

They are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).


While Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles. 


. . . . . . .


TLDR;

GOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE. 



. . . . . 


EDIT 1 - I'm not trying to predict the Stock Market or Share Prices of Google or Tesla. I have no idea how fast Google stock will move up or down.  I'm just a nerd who loves tech and I'm specifically talking about the tech here.

In 1 year, when it rolls off the production line, you will be able to hail a Robovan, configured to have a bedroom. It will pick you up in the city center, in the evening, and you will sleep in it, while it drives you outside of the city. It will find parking and drop you off at 8 AM in front of your workplace, with a hot coffee and breakfast, which will have been delivered into the Robovan while you slept. I believe this is 1-2 years away.

Imagine you can live in a robovan for $8 a day (or $1 per hour)...basically IN THE CENTER of New York. That's $2800 per year, or $140,000 in a lifetime. You wouldn't be able to buy a cardboard box in NY for that price.¬†

TESLA CYBERCAB VS WAYMO : AN ANALYSIS ,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g188s3/tesla_cybercab_vs_waymo_an_analysis/,149,1728648554.0,"For all the regards who don't know, Waymo is the market leader in true autonomous vehicles right now. They have been operating a fleet of robo taxis (fully autonomous cars) in multiple cities for a while now. 

So I did a short comparison and analysis. 



KEY POINTS FROM ""WE, ROBOT"" EVENT:



1. The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production.

.
.

2. Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab production by 2026 ‚Äî although he said it could be as late as 2027. 

.
.

3. Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000-$30,000, and is capable of performing various tasks.


.
.

4. Cybercab was revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla's ""We, Robot‚Äù event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of non-public roads for the demonstration. 


.
.

5. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn't rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature


.
.
.


TESLA VS WAYMO : KEY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACH 



.
.

1. Sensing the World:

 -  - Waymo's Multi-Sensor Fusion:  Waymo uses a suite of sensors that work together. This is like having multiple senses.


I. Lidar:  Acts like super-precise radar, creating a 3D ""point cloud"" of the surroundings. This excels in low-light and complex environments.

II. Radar: Detects objects and their speed, even in rain or fog.
   

III. Cameras: Provide visual information for recognizing objects like traffic lights and pedestrians.




- - Tesla's Vision-Only System: Tesla relies heavily on cameras, believing that they can provide enough data for AI to understand the world like humans do.


I. Neural Networks:  Tesla uses powerful AI to process the visual data from cameras.


II. No Lidar:  Tesla famously excludes lidar, arguing it's expensive and unnecessary.


- Why this matters:  Lidar provides highly accurate depth and distance data, which is crucial for navigating complex situations. Tesla's vision-only approach is more ambitious but may struggle in conditions where cameras are less effective (e.g., heavy rain, fog).



.
.


2. Understanding the Environment:

I. Waymo's HD Maps: Waymo creates incredibly detailed 3D maps of the areas where its vehicles operate. These maps include road geometry, lane markings, traffic signs, and even the positions of trees and buildings.


II.  Localization: This allows Waymo's cars to precisely locate themselves within the map, even in challenging conditions.


III. Predictability:  Maps help anticipate what's coming and plan routes accordingly.


IV.  Tesla's Real-Time Learning: Tesla relies less on pre-mapped environments. Its AI learns to interpret the world in real-time, based on the data it gathers from its cameras.


V. Generalization: The goal is to create a system that can drive anywhere, not just in pre-mapped areas.


VI. Adaptability: Tesla's system can potentially adapt to new environments and situations more quickly.



- - Why this matters: Waymo's HD maps provide a high level of certainty in known areas, but mapping is expensive and time-consuming. Tesla's approach is more scalable but relies heavily on the AI's ability to correctly interpret complex scenes.



.
.
.

3. Deployment Strategies:

I. Waymo's Gradual Rollout: Waymo has focused on deploying its robotaxi service in specific cities, starting with Phoenix. This allows for careful testing and refinement in controlled environments.


II.  Safety First:  Waymo prioritizes safety and has a strong track record.

III.  Controlled Expansion:  They expand their service area gradually as they gain confidence in their technology.



 IV.  Tesla's Beta Testing: Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to a wider group of drivers. This allows them to gather vast amounts of real-world driving data.


V.  Rapid Iteration:  Tesla can quickly improve its system through frequent software updates.


 VI. Driver Responsibility:  FSD is still a driver-assist system, and drivers are expected to remain vigilant and take over when necessary.


- -  Why this matters: Waymo's approach is more cautious, prioritizing safety and controlled testing. Tesla's approach is faster and more agile, but it also carries more risk, as evidenced by accidents involving FSD.



These are some of the core differences between Waymo and Tesla's approach to self-driving. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of technology, but their philosophies and strategies are quite distinct. It will be fascinating to see how these approaches evolve in the years to come.



. . . . . .  . 


EDIT:  THE MUSK PARADOX 


The entire Tesla brand is highly dependent on Elon. Essentially Elon is Tesla. A lot of the Tesla Brand value is tied up with Elon Musk the human.

This wasn't a problem in the past when Elon seemed like a nerd who just loved tech and posted memes.

Fast forward to 2024, the guy is full blow republican (not saying it's bad or good). He is actively involved with politics.

IMO, He's too busy ""owning the libs"" and fighting cultural wars (""woke virus""). 

Now combine this with his other behavioral problems like self administration of ketamine and using other drugs, and we have a recipe for disaster.


FYI, I'm not an Elon Hater. I used to admire him and it's sad to watch his downfall.


. . . . .


. . . . .

TLDR;


IMO, the event was Very Disappointing. 

Elon announced (NOT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED) basically what he has been promising for years (TRUE AUTONOMY AKA FSD).

It was no different than the previous announcements of FSD and Cybertruk.

I expect delays (regulatory approvals and the actual tech being ready).


. . . . .



. . . . . 


UPDATE :

. . . . . 

For all the regards who don't understand what WAYMO actually is, I just did another post analyzing Google (the owner of Waymo) and why they're the number 1 player in AI, robotics and self driving.

Overstock.com (BYON) - DD - Bath Towels Are Back In Stock,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g19wop/overstockcom_byon_dd_bath_towels_are_back_in_stock/,23,1728653629.0,"\*\*ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) and has rebranded itself.¬†Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before.

Alright, listen up, you‚Äôre only going to hear this once, and you‚Äôre only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I‚Äôve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in.

About the Company:

[Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore.

In 2023, the former crowd favorite‚Äôs bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI‚Äôs color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company‚Äôs name on it. (From here on I‚Äôll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.)

But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining.

Enter Marcus Lemonis:



https://preview.redd.it/yi3ayo0yw4ud1.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a79453f4375c3d023bbe6b615fea95091281919

He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He‚Äôs an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com), and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) website.

So this is what happened:

  


https://preview.redd.it/k29wwhq1x4ud1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f07b394c5fae9a6100f0485d99947b5ca5fa0f

Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together.

If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me:

‚ÄúMr. Jimbles, you‚Äôre *highly* regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.‚Äù

And to which I will respond:

‚ÄúWhy yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They‚Äôd love to have you. You‚Äôll fit right in there.‚Äù

But this what has happened very recently:

* In July 2024 the [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.¬†
* The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven‚Äôt heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods.
* Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily‚Äôs former team, and are bringing back your mom‚Äôs favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven‚Äôt made any official announcement yet. [Zulily.com](http://zulily.com)
* Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can‚Äôt download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have.
* They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally.
* They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves.

But that isn‚Äôt it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way.

And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn‚Äôt as of right now. Lucky me.

Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though.

What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know.

You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go:

  


https://preview.redd.it/rrf6twx4x4ud1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=3919615e3efb1dfb2c607e2ceda81efa27f7b49c

On the daily, it‚Äôs consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife‚Äôs boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days.

Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries:

So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I‚Äôve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn‚Äôt know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet.

Here‚Äôs the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10:

[https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx](https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx)¬†

Listen to it‚Ä¶or don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now.

If you still aren‚Äôt convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it‚Äôs up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least *she* might be proud of you.

So what do I expect with the BYON stock?

Short/medium term: Up.  
Long term: Really up.

It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don‚Äôt think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn‚Äôt, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES.

Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished.

Positions:

https://preview.redd.it/ikdcrnv7x4ud1.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc49f739ee9e7bf277bac88bd08ed12d3e52abcb

Shotgun approach.¬†Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves.

The random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times.

\*\*Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash:

Liquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. *wait.* You're thinking you'll just avoid all this by buying ITM/NTM? On a stock this undervalued?? Go back to where you belong. You know...that special sub where their best and only advice is DCA'ing into SPY.

I recommend doing limits or 1 lot market orders b/c you might even get a few better fills that way. If you do big market orders you‚Äôre gonna get cucked on the way in and on the way out‚Ä¶ if you make it that far. If you don‚Äôt know what the word slippage means...good luck. \*\*Hint\*\* It doesn't have anything to do with what happens to your wife while watching you unbutton her boyfriend's sport-coat.

See y'all in a bit.

My main strategy was SPY calls, I would wait for a quick sell off, and buy in. If it went against me, I would buy more. Cut loses at 25%.

I would buy calls depending on how i perceived sentiment. I strongly believe what makes a trader successful, is if he or she can effectively gauge sentiment. Not lines on a chart and dumb shit like ‚Äúbollinger bands.‚Äù

I do not consider myself a successful trading overall, but I can say that sentiment is everything.

Coursera (COUR) and Udemy (UDMY) currently valued at ~1.8x and ~1.6x revenue multiple respectively (I‚Äôm bullish),8,https://i.redd.it/qjoam7hvn6ud1.jpeg,10,1728676873.0,"Coursera is at ~$680m annualized revenue, growing 11% YoY, at -17% EBITDA margin. 

Udemy is at ~$780m of annualized revenue, growing 9% YoY, at a -12% EBITDA margin. 

Both are based out of California, IPO‚Äôd in 2021, and were founded around the same time as each other (2010 and 2012). Both IPO‚Äôd at wildly higher valuations than they currently trade at. Both are sitting at near all time lows. Basically the same company at this point lol. 

Given that the average SaaS trades around 6.4x annualized revenue while growing around 12% YoY, I think both are pretty undervalued right now.

What do you guys think? Will E-learning have another moment in 2025? I think it probably will and I‚Äôm bullish on these two for next year, but that‚Äôs not financial advice, dyor :)

They have not been profitable since before COVID and their failed merger with JetBlue has caused their stock to plummet by 95% in the past years. Recently, the WSJ has reported that Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy which should not be confused for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy involves the immediate selling of assets to pay back creditors while Chapter 11 is less severe and involves a reorganizational plan to pay back their debt. This distinction is very important because it does not mean that Spirit Airlines is for sure a dead company....yet?...maybe?

Creditors

* Spirit Airlines faces a deadline from its creditors to refinance or extend those notes by 10/21
   * If Spirit is able to refinance their debt, I would safely say that their stock price would increase
   * In addition, if Spirit was able to refinance their debt, this could allow Spirit to tap into the capital market and help them raise more money for a potential turnaround in the future
* Creditors may be inclined to extend their notes because they also have a lot to loose and the Justice Department claiming that Spirit is essential for travelers could build more confidence in the company

Earnings

* Earnings are expected to drop on 10/24 and the estimate is -$2.32...
   * This honestly is not surprising and I can see it going even lower then estimated but I also think it will not affect the price of the stock much
* If Spirit was to beat earnings, it could possibly prove that this company is still alive and has a potential for a turnaround

I felt like updating you guys about Spirit and their potential for a come back but who knows, I am just a Wendy's employee

Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway has sold $10.5bn worth of Bank of America shares in a selling spree that began in July, as the sprawling industrial conglomerate dumps an investment that dates to the global financial crisis. 

The company disclosed on Thursday that it had sold a further 13.6mn shares this week worth $546mn, taking Berkshire‚Äôs stake in the bank below 10 per cent.

That threshold is critical and means Berkshire will no longer have to report its dispositions of Bank of America stock within days of the transactions. Berkshire‚Äôs remaining stake is worth roughly $31bn.

17 years ago today,1250,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g02ah1/17_years_ago_today/,427,1728508296.0,"On September 18, 2007, the Fed made a 50bps rate cut, greater than expected, despite reasonably good economic data. Markets rallied for about 3 weeks, and SPX closed at an all-time high on October 9, 2007, which would not be matched again until March 2013 in recovery from the Great Financial Crisis.

On September 18, 2024, the Fed made a 50bps rate cut, greater than expected, despite reasonably good economic data. Markets rallied for about 3 weeks, and SPX closed at an all-time high today, October 9, 2024.

This is not financial advice nearly as much as it is anecdotal evidence that we live in the Matrix.

Other thoughts:

The Sahm rule stood at only 17bps as of the unemployment reading of September 2007, as opposed to 50bps in September 2024. Albeit, unemployment was generally higher right around 4.6-4.7% between late 2006-2007. Additionally, the part-time gig economy is MASSIVE today compared to 2007 (but BLS still counts that as not ‚Äúunemployed‚Äù)

The VIX was hovering between 16-18 during the October 2007 market peak, compared to 20-22 today.

Year-over-year CPI change from December 2006 to December 2007 was 4.1%, so inflation was NOT dead when the Fed started their easing cycle. The bond market is implying a similar problem in today‚Äôs economy with increasing US treasury yields, although current YoY CPI readings are generally lower today than in 2007.

Unlike 2007, this is an election year, and I operate under the assumption that all current BLS statistics are not just cooked, but deep fried.

EDIT: Going to try to address some of the repeated comments I‚Äôm seeing here.

‚ÄúPAST PERFORMANCE DOESN‚ÄôT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS‚Äù

Of course, the main point of this post was to highlight the similarities in timelines between today and 17 years ago. Our economic situation is MASSIVELY different, although I‚Äôd argue still weak.

‚ÄúBUT THERE‚ÄôS NO SUBPRIME CRISIS‚Äù

Right, probably not. However, we still have skyrocketing consumer credit defaults paired with an abysmally low personal savings rate. Additionally, we have something along the lines of $1 trillion CRE loans with balloon payments or adjustable rates kicking in within the next 6 months, on a bunch of loans that are underwater with their respective banks, and many of which have been collateralized into CLOs and sold both domestically and internationally. I still think there will be some blood in the water.

Additionally, the median house price to median income ratio is HIGHER today than it was at its 2007-2008 absolute peak, so I‚Äôd still argue that real estate has been over-speculated.

‚ÄúTHE GOVERNMENT WON‚ÄôT LET THE MARKET CRASH DURING AN ELECTION YEAR‚Äù

Probably not! In fact, there‚Äôs a very real scenario where the Fed steps in with hyper-QE if things hit the fan. Congress is scheduled to meet in January 2025 to negotiate the current US debt ceiling, and the US frankly can‚Äôt afford a recession right now - they need those tax dollars. Hyperinflation to erode the real value of the US debt and prop up the markets is highly plausible IMO.

‚ÄúDUMB BER‚Äù

Dumb bol.

‚ÄúPOSITIONS OR BAN‚Äù

I‚Äôm short term bullish on bonds. TLT just bounced off its 200 SMA twice and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see investors eat up those nice high yields if earnings season goes sour. I have 6 figures on TLT calls expiring post-election, I‚Äôm gonna wait on SPX plays until the election is over.

**TLDR: The Fed cut rates on the exact same date (9/18) in 2007 as 2024, and SPX hit an all-time high on the exact same date (10/9) in 2007 as 2024, except it was a massive crash afterwards in 2007. Trippy.**"

Go watch some NHL video from 1980. Now watch some NHL video from today. Those idiots in 1980 would absolutely suck today. They'd be too slow and too dumb to play anywhere near the top league today. Same with other sports. 

That's human nature. Through time we improve incrementally. We use the knowledge of prior generations as a base and add to it. So it's no surprise that an NBA player from 1980 would look like Krusty the Clown on a modern NBA team.

Well guess what, same shit has happened in investing & trading. And on an even bigger scale. The stakes are much higher. Instead of your high school star athlete making the big leagues, we're talking about the most powerful companies in the world making superyacht money. The amount of resources devoted to ""solving"" markets is astronomical.

So now we have a different landscape from your dad's stupid tech company in 1998. Yeah, they were cute firing up their shitty computers and randomly pressing some buttons in a suit & tie. Investors were onto something back in the 90's tech bubble though. They realized the trick to investing...

FRONT RUN EVERYTHING

Yeah bitch. Front run fucking everything. Radio on the internet? Fuck it, here's a billion dollars. Pets.com? Sure, you get $500M. Yeah, they took it a little too far in the 90's. But guess what, they were right. The internet was the future and the right early bets on internet companies made you wildly rich.

The reality was that, you could be wrong on 20 picks so long as you had the 1 Amazon / Microsoft / Apple. Plus, since people weren't front running as much back then, you didn't need to drop 100X Price-Sales on most of these picks (pre-1999). So who the fuck cares if you bought [Pets.com](http://Pets.com), [Broadcast.com](http://Broadcast.com), your dad's shitty tech startup? So long as you just accidentally bought one of the fucking juggernauts, all mistakes were easily forgiven.

So yeah, today we are thinking ""DAMN, Everything is so Expensive!"" ""AI is a Bubble!"" But guess what, that's just Boomer talk. From now on, everything that has a remote chance at being successful is gonna be front run to shit. You can forget about getting in at the bottom floor. Once an industry even hints that it will make a splash, some bastards are going to buy the shit out of it. The days where your dumb ass is gonna find Tesla at $10 or NVDA at $50 are long gone buddy.

So thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. Stop crying about valuations. The market is just smarter than it used to be. No one's saying THE PRICE IS RIGHT. They just don't give a fuck. Because a single 100X excuses 99 dingleberries."

Private Equity Taking Peloton Private? (PTON),13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g0oewr/private_equity_taking_peloton_private_pton/,9,1728581837.0,"Listen up regards,

[https://13f.info/manager/0001576350/cusip/70614W100](https://13f.info/manager/0001576350/cusip/70614W100)

GTCR, actual investors and not regards like yourselves, is probably taking Peloton private. It owns 14 million shares as of June 30 (, with a likely cost of $3.22 per share, representing 3.775% of the company‚Äôs shares outstanding (CSO). While GTCR has a history of fully buying out closely-held companies, that is unlikely to be the case here. If its purpose is to influence the board, a significant ownership stake is generally around 5% to 10% or more, which can provide leverage in discussions with the company. GTCR would need to acquire at least another 5-6 million shares to surpass the 5% threshold, which would require the firm to file a Schedule 13D, indicating control intent. My speculation is that GTCR will continue to buy shares throughout this quarter and beyond to gain leverage with the board, especially as the company searches for a permanent CEO. The timing seems well-suited for both Peloton‚Äôs corporate restructuring and GTCR‚Äôs long-term strategy to influence control of the company. We will know more next quarter from its 13F disclosure.

Celsius ($CELH) the 200mg caffeine nectar from the Gods that blasted onto, and disrupted, the entire energy drink scene.  The growth has been unprecedented in the soft drink scene.  Revenue has grown 24% YOY, and increased $80 million dollars last quarter alone.   Not only is it growing fast, but profit margins also keep improving each quarter.  This is a healthy, thriving, and GROWING business.  Foreign markets are still essentially untapped; once it expands globally, this thing will be a giant.  The stock price this year, however, has not been reflective of the company's success.  Pepsi is one of the main distributors of Celsius, and they bought a little too much inventory so there will be some smaller orders in the short term.  Ok cool, don't care.  There has been some bad press around the energy drink market in general saying consumers are buying less because of inflation.  Still don't care.  $CELH is now cheaper on a P/E basis than Coca-Cola, which is a ZERO GROWTH stagnant company.  While the stock has been getting gutted this year, every cuck on wallstreet has put their grubby little hands in the honey pot and sold it short; and short interest has now grown to \~13%.  But ut-oh, is that Celsius' music? A 10% rip today is going to be a big problem if you're short.  Through this entire downswing, institutional investors have been gobbling up the stock, increasing their positions by more that 400% so far in 2024.  The smart money knows that this is a healthy company with bad press and charmin-soft mfs selling it for way too cheap.  It's currently extremely oversold based on the RSI and the MACD is curling.  I think it's coming back in a big way. The fundamentals are there.  The analytics are there.  Where are you?

**The Numbers** 

* **Market Cap:** $34 billion
* **Debt:** Zero. Yep, you read that right. Lululemon has a clean balance sheet.
* **Free Cash Flow:** Last year, they generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow, which is pretty solid compared to their $1.6 billion net income. 



**Growth Rates Are Great**

* **10-Year Revenue Growth:** 19.7%
* **5-Year Revenue Growth:** 23.5%
* **3-Year Revenue Growth:** 25.5%



Lululemon has been on a growth tear, but the stock price has taken a hit. It peaked at $516 in December 2023 and is now down about 45%. I don't know the story for the drop.

**Brand Power**

Lulu has a cult-like following. People love this brand. The community and lifestyle they promote are strong. But sentiment can shift quickly, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre seeing now.



**Break Down**

* **ROIC:** Amazing returns on invested capital.
* **Cash Flow Growth:** More cash flow growth than net income growth over the last five years.
* **Low Debt:** They‚Äôre in a great position here.



**Analyst Projections**

Analysts expect Lululemon to double its EPS by January 2029. Feels bold but really just a matter of it's old multiples coming back into play.

All in on LUNR,441,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fzvgfc/all_in_on_lunr/,191,1728491034.0,"I've been trading Intuitive Machines since mid 2023 and after the IM1 pullback consolidated my whole portfolio into Jan LUNR call options. The price is down today after spiking to $9 post NSN contract announcement. I look for a culmination of factors - not the least of which is a solid, cohesive, and inspired core team - when making such a bet, and I am supremely confident this stock will hit at least $12 by end of year with the potential, of course, to run much higher. This is how I anticipate it playing out.

The recent 4.8B NSN contract win is mind blowing. The market, in my view, has not yet come to terms with the implications of this contract as we see the price today pulling back to the low 7s. As we make our way to Nov earnings we should expect a gradual increase and a solid earnings beat, which will propel the stock higher leading up to the second moon landing mission (IM2) currently on track for early 2025. Exact date has yet to be announced. IM1 ralled the stock to $13 before it came back to earth. IM2 may not have the same hype, but the company is in a radically different position than it was a year prior.

Buying this stock today is a steal and if I had more to invest I'd pull the trigger without hesitation. NFA, DYOR, etc.

PS. I have RKLB as a close second in terms of value. I'd be in RKLB too if I didn't put everything in LUNR. I may diversify into RKLB at some point in Q1. Once these calls are realized I'll likely just buy and hold the stock long term.

So my current crusade is essentially just buying LEAP puts on VIX ETFs such as UVXY and UVIX. This isn't the typical ""Short the VIX"" play, as my bearishness on these ETFs comes from something else. The conviction I have for this play comes from the long-term backwardation that occurs with these futures ETFs, where if you literally zoom out to any time frame longer than 2 years on any VIX futures ETF, you will see that most of them are down 70-90% from that time frame, and if you check their whole price history since their inception, it will most probably be down like 99%. I've only checked the price history of put options on UVXY dating back to about 6 months ago, and it seems like the prices are trending up like I expected them, but I would like to get some more price data dating back to as long as possible to see there isn't some regarded options variable I forgot to consider, which is why I have reserved some time at my university's trading lab on a bloomberg terminal later this week to get that price history.

Pre-earnings calls on INGR (Ingredion),7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g0ktro/preearnings_calls_on_ingr_ingredion/,3,1728572453.0,"I bought 20 INGR 11/15 C $130 this morning to profit from an expected run-up in IV and delta prior to earnings being released on 11/5.

I'm using the same analysis that I used for ADSK (+40% return), GTLB (+45% return), COST (+20% return), PGR (+28% return), and CAT (+25% return). You can see deets on those in my post history.

First, here's what my model predicts:

https://preview.redd.it/mw8a6y2ozxtd1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=50eef67e1fb2c60b19ab43fe56b7bad8c96ce6a2

It says a fair value right now for the contracts is about $7.5; I got mine for $7. A Monte Carlo simulation based on the underlying stock's historical behavior in the 30 days leading up to earnings and ATM contract IV run-up suggests the option should, on average, rise in value over the next 30 days. The upper red line is the 90% percentile, the blue line is the mean, and the lower lines are the 10% and 1%, respectively.

Based on fundamentals, I think we'll see the stock rise over the next 30 days, because:

* INGR always beats EPS estimates, so as forecasts start getting dialed in over the next few weeks, buying should pick up.
* The company has an internal initiative called ""Cost2Compete"", started last year, where they're driving down costs. As they predicted, this year sale revenue is down, but because of Cost2Compete their costs are down *lower* and so profit is up YoY.
* They are targeting $50M in cost savings by end of 2025, and are at $18M currently. They didn't revise that $50M number, so I expect to see higher savings this quarter than last, meaning even *higher* profitability.
* They withstood inflation and high rates just fine, and their forex impacts were a wash so far this year, so as inflation drops, sales should pick up. Combined with reduced costs, they should show excellent earnings, and I think the market will foresee that.
* Their guidance for this coming quarter is still conservative, and was made pre-rate cuts and inflation reports, so sales might *already* be up.

I'll be looking to close this one around 25-30%, depending on how IV goes over the next week or two."

TSMC, as one of NVIDIA‚Äôs key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA‚Äôs prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA.

Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may *revise* their ratings or ***price targets*** for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a **spike** in NVDA‚Äôs stock price. 

Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA‚Äôs growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before.

Do you believe TSMC‚Äôs earnings will positively impact NVIDIA? Are you planning to make any moves based on this news? Let‚Äôs discuss!

Why I Think There‚Äôs an 85% Chance the Market Goes Up Tomorrow After CPI Data,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fzw52s/why_i_think_theres_an_85_chance_the_market_goes/,79,1728492748.0,"With the CPI data set to be released tomorrow, I'm feeling optimistic about the market's potential to close in the green. Here‚Äôs why I believe there's an 85% chance the market will rise following the CPI announcement:

Projected Inflation Rates: Analysts are forecasting a year-over-year CPI increase of around 2.3%, which would be a significant drop from previous months

If this prediction holds true, it signals easing inflationary pressures, which typically boosts investor confidence.  
Market Sentiment: Historical trends suggest that when CPI data comes in lower than expected, markets, particularly the Nasdaq, often react positively. A lower inflation rate might lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve will take a less aggressive approach to interest rate hikes.

This sentiment could drive up stock prices as investors shift their focus back to growth opportunities.  
External Factors: Recent trends show declining energy prices, which have contributed to lowering overall inflation‚Äã.

If these trends continue and align with the CPI data, it could further reinforce a bullish outlook among traders.  
Earnings and Economic Indicators: Positive reports from the labor market and other economic indicators support the idea that the economy is on solid footing.

If the CPI data confirms this narrative, we could see a substantial market rally.  
Of course, nothing is guaranteed in the markets, but the combination of favorable CPI projections, historical market responses, and supportive economic conditions gives me a strong sense of optimism.

What do you all think? Are you expecting a green day for the market tomorrow?"

Impact of Baxter‚Äôs (BAX): IV Facility Shutdown and Potential Financial Upside for ICU Medical (ICUI),10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fzv3uu/impact_of_baxters_bax_iv_facility_shutdown_and/,18,1728490176.0,"**Baxter‚Äôs Financial Loss**

Baxter International‚Äôs (BAX) North Cove facility, [producing 60% of IV fluids nationally](https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/helene-ravaged-the-nc-plant-that-makes-60-of-the-countrys-iv-fluid-supply/), has been shut down due to flooding from Hurricane Helene and will not be operational for several months at best. This closure could significantly impact Baxter‚Äôs revenue and operations:

* Revenue Loss: The North Cove plant likely contributes 20-30% of the Medication Delivery segment, translating to an estimated annual revenue loss of $1.18 billion to $2.22 billion.
* Operational Costs: Additional costs for damage assessment and remediation could range from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.
* Market Share: The inability to supply IV fluids may lead to a loss of market share to competitors.

**ICU Medical‚Äôs Potential Upside**

ICU Medical (ICUI) stands to benefit from Baxter‚Äôs supply disruption:

* Increased Sales: Capturing 10-20% of the market share lost by Baxter could result in an additional $118 million to $444 million in annual revenue.
* Market Expansion: This opportunity allows ICU Medical to strengthen customer relationships and [expand its market presence](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-helene-hospitals-iv-fluid-shortage/).
* Strategic Positioning: Ensuring reliable supply and managing increased demand can enhance ICU Medical‚Äôs reputation and secure long-term contracts.

In summary, Baxter‚Äôs North Cove facility shutdown could lead to significant financial losses, while ICU Medical could see substantial revenue gains and market expansion opportunities.

Other companies such as B. Braun Medical will also benefit, but from my research only ICU Medical is publicly traded.

# Edit to add:

B. Braun Medical, the nation‚Äôs second-largest supplier of IV solutions, has their newest IV fluid producing facility located directly in the projected path of hurricane Milton in Daytona Beach FL.   Should that get hit hard tonight, ICUI may see an even more extreme bump in Q4 sales than if only Baxter was impacted, and growth in-line with whatever their physical limits are to ship IV supplies."

First off, if you're in the path of the hurricane. GTFO ASAP.  
Just get out! Stay safe. Your life is more important than any material possession. God protect you all.

2nd off.  
Two major hurricanes hitting roughly the same area just weeks apart is going to multiply the devastation. It's highly probable that many counties in Florida will be completely uninsurable following this. This will create many insurance losers and other winners.

3rd off  
This will have ramifications across the market.  
Energy prices will shoot up and stay higher for longer. Oil prices are already up significantly since the Iran missile attack and hurricane Helene just in the last couple of weeks.  
Expect energy prices to stay higher for longer.

Hurricane Helene is estimated to have caused so far 50 billion dollars in damages. These losses are expected to be compounded by Milton. Which is already stronger and larger and is strengthening even more as it approaches Florida.

4th TLDR  
How the F do I as a regard trade this?  
$GNRC Generac for generators.  
$URI United Rentals, folks are going to need to rent all sorts of things. From pumps, generators and equipment.  
$HUBB Hubbell for electrical infrastructure that will need to be rebuilt across Florida and other states.  
$XLE & $XOP oil & gas ETFs due to the sudden drop in supply that these hurricanes have caused, leading energy prices to rise.

Karma is real. This is not intended for folks to profit off other people's suffering. The purpose is to know how to react accordingly when something big like this that is outside of our control.  If anything, if you make money off of this please consider donating to the victims of these weather events.

God bless & stay regarded all."

- Long-term potential gains if the separated units like Android, YouTube, or Cloud are valued more individually.

LEU - Nuclear Boogaloo,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fzevyv/leu_nuclear_boogaloo/,21,1728433431.0," The premise of this post and my thesis is simple. Humanity‚Äôs power consumption will only grow over time, precipitously so with AI AI AI‚Ñ¢ everywhere, and the only way to meet those consumption needs is via nuclear power. 

So far I‚Äôm not mentioning anything novel. The nuclear theme has been hot as of late and a lot of names have run a bit. However, I wanted to find a name or two that had outsized return potential, and I think I‚Äôve found it. And after a week or so of ‚Äúexhaustive research‚Äù, I have arrived at such a name:

&#x200B;

Centrus Energy - LEU

Let‚Äôs start with the basics thanks to one of the biggest consumers of energy at the moment:

*Centrus Energy is a company focused on the production and supply of low-enriched uranium for the nuclear power industry. It provides fuel and related services to nuclear power plants, aiming to support clean energy generation and enhance energy security.*

Cool. A bunch of nerds enriching uranium, specifically ‚ÄúLEU‚Äù (yes it‚Äôs the ticker for the company AND the main product they produce): Low Enriched Uranium. Why does this matter? Well, the vast majority of ""traditional"" reactors that exist within the United States today leverage LEU for fuel. And oh by the way, those reactors that were so dangerous and scary in the past (due to the general public being fucking stupid) are now coming back online because, shocker, we have no other choice and nuclear energy is actually INCREDIBLY safe, reliable and efficient.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/31hl2oy0hltd1.jpg?width=804&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bf2a8c2922bbd39164dbe05f840e7c2c26722eb

So how does Centrus benefit from all of this? Well, direct from one of their recent SEC filings, they call it out for the reader:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0dirwyz1hltd1.jpg?width=1689&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=527234d7769596179b3682ca290b3919d03cd011

Not only are they one of the main suppliers for LEU, they are the ONLY supplier of HALEU with an NRC License (Nuclear Regulatory Commission)..

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/81v5vj03hltd1.jpg?width=1166&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac288df06026c5c7c104acb639cfcbadbaa82e51

Woah, an extra two words at the beginning, what‚Äôs HALEU vs LEU? HALEU stands for High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium. The main difference between the two is that LEU is enriched to \~5% while HALEU is enriched to 20%. 

&#x200B;

[Ignore the one on the right, that's the scary one](https://preview.redd.it/2cfbskr3hltd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=162295eb1746a29fe852d119d7ed7b040aa25b5c)

So Centrus is the only NRC licensed supplier of HALEU. Big whoop. Why is HALEU a big deal? Because all of the \*next-gen\* reactors (OKLO, SMR, etc‚Ä¶) are going to require HALEU to function. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/artfqop5hltd1.jpg?width=915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9d5b9563badf6b25fd322426da46011a4f6fbad

The demand for HALEU is going to skyrocket and while there are global players, Centrus is the only domestic USA supplier of HALEU right now.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/szm92ko6hltd1.jpg?width=603&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d5bc735185266af7155421772bd865ea57d42b8

And with some other names out there (I won‚Äôt call them out as they‚Äôre below 500m mc) that are relying on hype and pitch decks for ridiculous nuclear technologies that aren‚Äôt feasible (at least in the next few decades), Centrus is actually delivering on their commitments. They are the only commercial provider that has actually delivered HALEU to the DOE, and they did so \*ahead of schedule\*!!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/chpzdes7hltd1.jpg?width=770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=496934a9b15da5659215250f18c8aee572a0d739

So we have a company with an incredibly well protected moat, within a very hot (heh) sector that‚Äôs gaining momentum. What else can we throw into the mix? Well, the upside in terms of revenue.

Centrus spells it out in their latest investor presentation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kd1vd3g8hltd1.jpg?width=558&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73eca304f6b0f66c639f0837925386da9a775b9b

But this is also reinforced by the RFP activity and awards being handed out by the government to companies that are involved in this space. And, once again, Centrus is the \*sole\* public company that competes in the market of LEU and HALEU supply. What is kind of hilarious is the fact that on the DOE RFP page, they literally call out the near-monopoly Centrus has in this space in theri Q&A section:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s0hhxs29hltd1.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cc0ae087e677fab079ab43277621b04968bf56f

As of this last Friday, October 4th, the DOE awarded $800m in TCV (total contract value) to 4 RFP respondents, which includes Centrus (their subsidiary American Centrifuge Operating LLC), $BWXT and 2 private companies. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/49g6zuo7iltd1.jpg?width=678&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fe66d604d54b2a1d50dc367cb4d7f9a68e762a5

BWXT is another nuclear aligned name that has great upside, and it‚Äôs worth noting that they actually have an equity interest in Centrus.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v0uc7yx9hltd1.jpg?width=584&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2aa36583931e7685a759d5e417e0f96e0d4576e

The contract ceiling for the ‚ÄúHALEU Deconversion‚Äù award is $2.7b

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/prh26glahltd1.jpg?width=1212&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4de46494e752b41b42715afa669a443f32a577a0

Additionally, via Centrus 8-k filings, they note that this is just one RFP and there are others (at least one) that are still pending:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8616mvfbhltd1.jpg?width=1681&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3599b8a428687e0e55e1e26a0a0aadc33ff9bf2b

‚ÄúBut wait a second, Centrus in the $30 range a month ago and now it‚Äôs $65 (at closing on October 8th), it‚Äôs done! Cooked!‚Äù -derp

&#x200B;

[derp](https://i.redd.it/hs311h9ohltd1.gif)

Yea, bullshit. Checked the marketcap \~$1b), check the opportunity laid out here and in the news/SEC filings. Next, lets see what institutional investors have been doing with Centrus:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ssn245chltd1.jpg?width=1205&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa04c028b08b66fc43975491f4456f14faae23e9

Well shit, they‚Äôve been loading the boat. And even after this last month‚Äôs run, it‚Äôs still undervalued. The short exposure to this stock has also been increasing, which is an added layer of dimensionality to the name.

So what could nuke (heh) this trade? A few things. Bad industry PR is \*always\* a risk when it comes to nuclear power/energy. Next could be dilution. They aren‚Äôt strapped for cash, but they‚Äôve used their current ATM over the past year. Despite that, they are not serial dilutors (which you can verify yourself):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpzkn7vdhltd1.jpg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c263675266a2c03d3e7f4cd2398154ec79c09399

Another risk one might consider is political. As we have a presidential election coming up, the incoming president‚Äôs policy may have a huge impact on investments. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that public sentiment for nuclear energy is near ATHs and both candidates have expressed positive opinions on domestic nuclear energy. Trump more explicit vs. Harris being a bit more guarded on her energy policy.

&#x200B;

[Trump policy example](https://preview.redd.it/9v1iw86fhltd1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=845702d8a68d30b0f55474c06803916b0d7a5cf2)

**Tl;dr**

**Centrus Energy represents a unique and differentiated opportunity within the nuclear basket, one that involves a company that is \*actually making money\* and has a well protected and actively demonstrated moat.** 

Long shares and Nov/Jan calls. Worth noting that after this run up, premiums are definitely juiced. Chasing OTM calls here is a sure way to get rekt at least until IV cools down a bit. I‚Äôve also thrown money at $BWXT and $CW for broader nuclear plays as I genuinely believe nuclear power is only going to become more and more important within the United States and the rest of the world."

"When will ""investor"" delusion end?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g0evmf/when_will_investor_delusion_end/,70,1728552596.0,"I'm new, please don't bully me, I have no clue what is going on which is why I use really basic concepts in my explanation.

Growth Investment vs. Value Investment. ¬†

One one hand, there are growth stocks; Wall Street currently is in overdrive, investors are hyper-optimistic and companies like tickers: TSMC and NVDA are trading far above their average P/E ratios, these types of companies are called growth stocks because investors are betting that in the future, their ‚Äúvaluations‚Äù will be justified by NVDA‚Äôs performance, instead of investing in intrinsic value, shareholders are investing in the IMPLICIT VALUE of a company, which is what they perceive the future intrinsic value of a company will be.¬†

When the economy is doing well (as it is now, kinda, I think), growth stocks do well; this is because demand for goods and services goes up, interest rates go down, revenues for businesses go up, borrowing is cheaper and technology companies like NVDA can capitalize off of that to fund R&D, growing the scale of operations and benefitting from economies of scale, justifying the IMPLICIT VALUATIONS, raising stock prices to the stratosphere.¬†

On the other hand, when the economy is receding as part of its natural cycle, the economy gets a ‚Äúreality check‚Äù, investors realize that their growth valuations were too optimistic and that their predictions won‚Äôt mature soon enough to achieve their desired ROI per annum. As a result, they flock to value investments because they realize that companies like Bank of America are resilient, undervalued and going to grow in a high-interest environment which we could be looking at in December.¬†

The same thing happens in a bubble, and it is no secret that AI is a bubble as of now considering the ludicrous difference in implicit and intrinsic valuations.¬†

Looking at NVDA, it is easy to see how we could be looking at the first half of a repeat of the 3D Printing bubble in 2014. ¬†

That is not to say that, 3D printing is akin to AI, however, it is almost guaranteed that NVDA fill be facing a significant correction (like AAPL did in December 2022 and December 2023) after a rally due to the incoming CPI data (unlike AAPL).¬†

We are too late to invest in growth stocks and too early to buy value stocks, so we are faced with a dilemma:¬†



How can we invest on the tipping point of the economy‚Äôs growth?¬†

To be honest, I have no fucking clue, however, with CPI data coming 8:00 E.T, that could change: if CPI is significantly higher than before, a world of high interest rate December will become much more visible, if it is significantly lower, then we will see a big rally for companies like NVDA. Anything in between a clear-cut CPI , will just muddy the waters as the stock market is rife with AI speculative delusion.¬†

What is certain, however, is that NVDA, sooner or later, will get a really painful reality check, and if you don‚Äôt believe me, you shouldn't, because I don't know what I'm yapping about.

What is going to happen? Are my puts fucked?

This past friday I took shrooms again, and to put my hypothesis of 'being in communication with the galaxy and recieving trading advice' to the test, I jotted down some earnings that would release this week. This included Pepsi, Dominos, Tilray, JPM and more. The plan was to come back after (or sometime during) the trip to my notes, and let the universe pick the stock to buy calls on. 

I took the shrooms and called an uber to the park, and started feeling it pretty soon. On the ride to the park, I remembered about the list of stocks and pulled out my notes app to see if any resonated with me at the time, but to no avail. I figured that I wasn't supposed to make any trades this time, until I looked out the window:

**A huge fucking Pepsi truck with the Pepsi logo right next to my window.** Can you imagine that? This had to be the sign.

I bought 50 shares of PEP, as well as 5 175.5 Calls. PEP releases earnigns tomorrow pre-market, and I was only able to make this post now. Sadly I am relaying this information to you all late, as I don't want to cause any losses to any of you. You could still buy shares in the after-hours market, if you feel like the sign from the shroom gods was too clear to ignore.

  
TLDR: Bought PEPSI calls after taking shrooms because I saw a Pepsi truck and figured it must be a sign from the universe.

I'm interested in investing in Anduril Industries, a private defense tech company, but I'm unsure of the steps, especially since it's not publicly traded. Can anyone share how you might invest in such a company before an IPO? Also, what are the risks and alternatives for someone not yet an accredited investor? Any experiences or advice on platforms like Forge or EquityZen would be greatly appreciated.

Additionally, if Anduril isn't directly investable for me, are there similar publicly traded companies or ETFs focusing on AI and autonomous systems in defense that could be worth exploring? Your insights on this niche would be invaluable.

Phase 3 Complete ü•≥. The answer to the multi year Alzheimer‚Äôs mystery imminent for Cassava Sciences $SAVA.,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fz1dwx/phase_3_complete_the_answer_to_the_multi_year/,86,1728398363.0,"After a brutal 3 years and an even more brutal summer of allegations against Dr. Wang (ex-scientist collaborator for SAVA), we have finally completed dosing for the first phase 3 trial.   Another couple of months and we should have the answer to this multi-year mystery of Alzheimer‚Äôs.  This is the last chance to invest in this promising drug before the potential rise despite the mainstream allegations against this company. Strap yourselves in, this is a long one. Jump to conclusion and tldr if you‚Äôre impatient.

**Allegations**

On June 28, the DoJ announced charges made against Dr. Wang  for scientific misconduct and fraud that gained him NIH funding. Here‚Äôs why I believe Dr. Wang will be found innocent. Back in 2021 a citizens petition was filed by ‚Äúwhistleblowers‚Äù to the FDA led by Dr. Bredt, a neurologist who had history with Dr. Wang back when Wang did work for Johnson & Johnson. Turns out they were not whistleblowers at all and were actually short sellers, and in the case of Dr. Bredt, a competitor.  Dr. Bredt, with support from Johnson & Johnson, founded RAPP Therapeutics that is developing small molecule drugs that follow the same mechanism as Cassava‚Äôs drug simufilam.  Ironic right? And he filed an IPO the same day the FDA rejected the citizens petition. What a coincidence right? Thru this citizens petition, Journal of Neuroscience posted an expression of concern for scientific misconduct and fabrication of Dr. Wang‚Äôs research data. Following this expression of concern, Dr. Wang submitted all the original data and blots to JoN in which they concluded there was no evidence of manipulation.  However, thanks to some motivated PhDs on Twitter, who lack any impactful research papers of their own, continued harassing the editors in which JoN issues an expression of concern and will defer to CUNY (that is a whole another fiasco with massive conflict of interests).  Recently the SEC announced settlements made with Casaava, its ex-senior executives, and Dr. Wang.  In Dr. Wang‚Äôs settlement, the SEC provides data which Dr. Wang could have unblinded himself in a reanalysis of a small 28 day study measuring biomarker changes in patients who received simufilam vs placebo. Now the only problem with their allegation that they settled for, the data they provided MATCHES a concurrent plasma biomarker analysis from a third party, independent and industry known company, Quanterix. I should just stop my post here but I will continue. After 3 years of senseless investigations by the DoJ and SEC, this is the best they can come up with. Hey this minor 28 day study of biomakers reanalysis could have been made up EVEN though quanterix data matches it. On top of all this, the biomakers in question were of a 28 day study. When they began their phase 2 cog study, they performed csf biomarker analysis after 6 months which showed 98% had a positive effect. There was never any question on this more significant biomarker analysis. There was never any question of the quanterix data.  It is without a doubt if there was even a hint of manipulation there it would been used to crucify Cassava. 

Why I think with all these allegations Cassava still has a high probability of success? Because I look at it as pieces of a puzzle.  There are many pieces involved in this mystery. Firstly and most importantly, there is the 24 month open label Adas-cog study that shows patients especially mild  have NO cognitive decline.  This has NEVER been heard of.  Additionally there are multiple independent sources of research that supports simufilam and the importance of Filamin A (the protein simufilam targets) in neuropathology including prestigious Yale. Yale even patented simufilam use for epilepsy. Included in the supporting research is the TR-Fret study that uses the most sophisticated assay (far superior than WBs) to prove simufilams MoA. Additionally there are the biomarkers from quanterix, the more important 6 month biomakers NEVER questioned, insiders suspiciously increasing positions earlier in the year, and the almost 90% of  patients choosing to continue in the open label extension of the Ph3 to stay on the drug and demanding to extend even the open label extension for early patients. I will post links to the research below.

**The Stock**

The float of this stock is almost 50% shorted and many big suits are involved imo. Can you see why they are trying to destroy the company. If this drug proves itself, this stock will be worth at the very least $50 Billlion in market cap and that‚Äôs without factoring in short interest.  Why they will not be successful in bringing this company down? Because there is a strong investor base made of doctors, PhDs, pharmacists, and engineers who have done multiple years of DD and will not be shaken.  As long as the data continues to impress, people will not be selling.

**Conclusion & Approach**

Someone said to me that if Dr. Wang lied about the biomakers then all of it is lie, which is absolutely true, and also can be said about the shorts.  So my approach to come to my conclusion is looking at all the independent pieces to this puzzle. The puzzle pieces all fit perfectly with Dr. Wangs preclincal research and biomarker analysis being correct. They do not fit with Dr. Wang committing fraud. To date Dr Wang has NOT been found guilty of fraud, only allegations.  Could ALL the independent institutions be lying about simufilam and Filamin A?  I think the DoJ will eventually drop the case or maybe slap on the wrist for record keeping issues.  Now let‚Äôs look at the shorts, the very first statement was a lie. They lied about being whistleblowers and they lied about being short sellers. Dr. Bredt lied about never hearing of Cassava when he had history with Dr. Wang, and he lied that he thought the science was nonsense.  Why do we know that‚Äôs a lie, because he literally started a company that is pursuing the same kind of small molecule targeting receptor associated proteins such as Filamin A.

So ask yourself, do you believe the shorts, the doj, the sec who we know for a fact are not retails friend? Just look at the madness in 2021. Or just maybe there is more to this story than what‚Äôs being reported by our wonderful mainstream media.  Just look at the state of this country and the influence of media. I really don‚Äôt care for anyone to invest but more to put the story out there. At this point it‚Äôs either the moon or the grave (not literally).

**TLDR:** Phase 3 is done will answer ALL questions with no doubt left, Too much independent research on simufilam and Filamin A (too many pieces of the puzzle fit perfectly together with Wang being innocent), SEC twists data to make it look bad now out the way after settlement. Ph3 data comes out by year end and stock will rocket if our thesis is correct by over 20X. Almost 50% of the float short is just a cherry on top. In other words SAVA to $500 if data good and $1,000 or more if amazing. If fail then no doubt 0 but I am highly convinced of success.

**New Positions:** 6,000 shares with avg cost $24(Don‚Äôt try it shorts I‚Äôll just add more) 10 $15 call leaps. First invested in 2021

Not financial or medical advice, do your own DD

**Links** of additional research on simufilam and Filamin A and there is much more than this. Do note some of the papers ‚Äî not all ‚Äî has wang as a author, but he **did not perform the experiments**,  it‚Äôs just his research being investigated by other scientists.

What Would Take to Rattle The Market.,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fzjgoo/what_would_take_to_rattle_the_market/,17,1728448480.0,"The question is why would the market sell-off? There's election, good jobs data, rate cuts so need negative news catalyst recently was ""*August 7th Israel Anniversary Response*"".

As long as election and rate cuts are in play, it'll take a change in sentiment. Hot CPI could change the tone, extensive hurricane damage, Israel responds, and Oct. 3rd quarter weakness sell-off.

If the market is going to rattle it'll take:

1. Hot CPI coming in on the 10th
2. Devastating hurricane damage reports 11th-15th
3. IL responding sometime this month with unexpected force
4. 3rd quarter weakness sell-off which didn't take place in Sept.

This is the bear case. Doesn't mean any of this will happen!

CPI comes in showing more cooling, hurricane is overlooked, IL doesn't respond this month, leads to a really weak 3rd quarter weakness sell-off *if any at all*. The elections, rate cuts and earning's seasons just about to start are such a powerful catalyst imo. Many very profitable companies last season trading flat or declining a bit, this season could be when they run like TSM/Amazon breaking $200."

I see a company's share price, and it tells me what the market currently values the company - no further research necessary. The price that I see is the true price of the stock today ,and everything there is to know and judge about the company is already reflected in the stock price. On the other hand is the thinking that there are undervalued/overvalued stocks out there that need to be identified through some deep research. However it occurs to me more and more that there is already someone ahead of me in these deep dives, and the stock price has already reflected whatever that finding may be. It's like a tug of war between technical analysis and fundamentals. Is there where the quants live? Do you have a similar internal debate going on, or is it just my degen brain?

"Why I think Intel is a Misunderstood, Undervalued Play ‚Äì A Bet on 18A (+EV DD)",147,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fyvlo8/why_i_think_intel_is_a_misunderstood_undervalued/,80,1728379205.0,"Alright boys, before you go full ape and call me smooth-brained for saying this again, let me follow up on [yesterday‚Äôs post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fye8fl/is_intc_undervalued/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and explain why I think [Intel ($INTC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC/) is undervalued and why it might be a decent play right now. I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that‚Äôs driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble.

Now, just to be clear, I‚Äôm not trying to convince anyone to follow what I‚Äôm saying here. This is just my take, and I‚Äôm throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought.

**Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here?**

Let‚Äôs start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon‚Äôs tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it‚Äôs important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it‚Äôs trading at or near book value. For those who don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs basically what the company‚Äôs assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go?

Sure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn‚Äôt just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We‚Äôve seen it happen before‚Äîcompanies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel‚Äôs price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it‚Äôs highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you‚Äôre paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve.

**Bad market sentiment doesn‚Äôt always last forever**

Market sentiment is trash right now. Everyone‚Äôs convinced that Intel is finished because they‚Äôve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel‚Äôs lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that‚Äôs where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream ‚Äúthey‚Äôre gonna fail‚Äù without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup.

**What‚Äôs 18A and why it matters**

Now, let‚Äôs get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it‚Äôs a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it‚Äôs a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years.

Let me be clear, I‚Äôm not saying 18A is a sure thing. It‚Äôs not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who‚Äôs short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they‚Äôve made.

**The Dice Roll Theory ‚Äì Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward**

So here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we‚Äôre looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock‚Äôs value.

Now, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it‚Äôs important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now.

**The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel‚Äôs importance to the U.S. government. They‚Äôre not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They‚Äôre not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around.**

**The CEO and Intel's strategy ‚Äì Misunderstood?**

Now let‚Äôs talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he‚Äôs actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he‚Äôs gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They‚Äôve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre betting it all on 18A.‚Äù That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach.

Yeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it‚Äôs bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They‚Äôre essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better.

**What about Intel‚Äôs other businesses?**

Let‚Äôs not forget, Intel isn‚Äôt a one-trick pony. They‚Äôve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn‚Äôt hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they‚Äôve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren‚Äôt just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them‚Äîthey‚Äôre diversifying their bets.

**The geopolitical angle ‚Äì U.S. needs Intel**

With all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn‚Äôt going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We‚Äôre seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever.

**Conclusion ‚Äì Why I‚Äôm betting on Intel**

To wrap this all up, here‚Äôs why I think Intel is worth a gamble:

* The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value.
* Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they‚Äôre not going to be left hanging.
* The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in.
* The CEO‚Äôs strategy is misunderstood. He‚Äôs sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival.
* The U.S. government‚Äôs focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel.

This is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm taking it.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking.

**TL;DR:** Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn‚Äôt going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play."

man man man. not too sure what happened this year, shit just feels like a blur tbh. 

2021 - 2022 i worked really hard to climb out of debt from gambling addiction. it wasn‚Äôt much at the time, around 20k or so in various loans and cc debt from gambling. i slipped up a few times in 22, but it was nothing major and i stopped myself before making any big losses.

fast forward fall of last year, i finally have money in my savings account for the first time in my life-20k or so. i was investing half of that into tech stocks for a couple months and was making some nice, chill gains. well, that shit was so fucking boring seeing +$50 a day or some shit like that.. i needed that thrill and excitement back in my life and this wasn‚Äôt cutting it. that‚Äôs when i moved back into 0dte options and that leads us to where we are today.

idk what it is, but something about 0dte‚Äôs and watching your money move up and down so drastically is some different shit. i pretty much payed my bills and lived pretty frugally and threw everything else into options ever since and continuously losing and blowing any gains i get. i find myself always fantasizing living some lavish life and how i could get that life from the next trade if i can get a 10 bagger. that‚Äôs when i lose it all and idk, it stopped feeling like anything after a while and if anything, it was kind of relieving and satisfying in a way.

so here i am, currently in ~60k of debt, stuck in this cycle of continuously trading any money i get.

much love guys. just felt like sharing tbh and hopefully you guys don‚Äôt follow my path! much love."

"2600% gain on TIGR options, profits over 1.1M Canadian dollars using 40k in less than 2 weeks",839,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fy7u0u/2600_gain_on_tigr_options_profits_over_11m/,186,1728308298.0,"**TLDR: Made over 1.1M Canadian Dollars using about 40k in multiple TIGR option buying and repositioning in less than 2 weeks. I wouldn't call it a degen gamble as I roughly talk about the reasoning and thought processes below. Though this particular opportunity came in as a surprise initially, it is within my trading style, plus 40k is only a small amount of my actual portfolio. In the screenshot the gaining percentage is rigged because it counted the the 40k deposit as gains as well, the true percentage is more like 2600-2700% rather than 20,000,000%+.**

**Edit: These trades were done in USD obviously, IBKR shows performance using my base currency(Canadian Dollars) however.**

**Edit 2: There are no ""Secret Scanners"" or ""Secret Watchlist"", it's just simple percentage gainers/losers available everywhere. The watchlist is constructed with hard work when the stock is not moving or not ""in play"", and they only specifically fit my trading style, it will be useless to others. Think of this way, would you commit the time and efforts to study hundreds of stocks like this TIGR when they are boring and not moving, then be ready when it begins to move?**

**PS: Reddit removed my previous post because I mentioned some ticker lower than 500M market cap, so if you see I talk about 4 companies but I only really show 3, you will know a company is removed from my original write up.**

On the morning of Sept 25, when I ran my scanner, there wasn't a lot of percentage gainers/losers. However, the ticker names YINN/YANG immediately caught my attention, they are the 3x bull/bear ETFs that track FTSE 50 index of Chinese stock market (we can think of it as SPY 50 instead of 500). At the time, they were up and down 20%+, I was like what just happened. When I went over to check the index, the SSE was up more than 4% in a single day! I quickly read over the news and realized that it's a huge huge opportunity, and perfect timing. The Chinese stock market has been in a bear market for a couple of years, this could be the inflection point, and it was only the second day. To give readers a little context about myself, I was born and raised in China, immigrated to Canada in my teenage, and started full time trading on my own after graduation from university, so I have no problem reading Chinese news (I will not discuss the news here or take any political view, the only thing I can say is if an experienced trader sees this news and market condition, he/she will know it's a big big opportunity).

What is TIGR? It's a brokerage firm that mainly operates in Singapore/Hong Kong and some other continents, but not mainland China due to the events that happened couple years ago, it is listed on the US exchange. The direct competitor is FUTU, which is another brokerage firm listed on the US exchange, with a larger market cap and user base. These two firms mainly serve Mandarin (or other types of Chinese variant) speakers around the world, but they of course support other languages. So why did I pick TIGR from the list of about 300 US listed Chinese companies? Well, there are many factors, I will very briefly discuss some of the important ones. Before I begin, I should make clear that real ""penny stocks"" should be filtered out with experience, which only leaves a certain number of companies left.

1. Market Ignorance on Growth: From the year of 2022 when TIGR is banned from doing business in mainland China, TIGR had somewhere around 50M revenue with very tiny profit (mostly just breakeven), the stock traded around 3-6 per ads/adr back then. Fast forward to 2024, in the most recent quarter, the company did 87M revenue with obvious profit, yet the stock price trades in the same range. Although I'm not using net revenue here, but the ratio on net revenue is similar. Also in the most recent quarter, there is a one time loss provision that had a negative non-recurring impact on earnings of that quarter, which I will discuss later. But the main point here is that the company obviously grew a lot (I used revenue/profit here just to illustrate, but we of course need to evaluate other metrics too, such as customer number, etc. I just can't list them all here.), yet the stock trades in the same range without any market attention, which is great for traders if we can spot them, wait patiently, and strike when it begins to go up with strong catalysts.
2. Valuation: Valuation is always a big factor when trading legit companies. In case of TIGR, when it traded in the 3s, the undervaluation is pretty obvious if the company is reporting true numbers. Before it started rising, it was trading around 3.5, which is about $550M market cap. Reading the 6K from EDGAR, we know the net asset of this company is about $500M, with almost no goodwill, intangibles, etc., because it's mostly a financial company. So it basically trades at its book value with almost no enterprise value. Yes it's a company in the financial sector with high leverage, but still. Compare it to its most direct competitor FUTU, who had around $10B market cap at 70s (stock price), with book value of about $3.5B. Run the revenue number, FUTU does about 4 times TIGR's revenue and trades about 20 times TIGR's market cap. Now for profit, TIGR actually traded at an incredibly low single digit P/E if we take the one time loss provision out and the revenue/profit growth momentum continues for TIGR. If one just spend 5 minutes reading over the earnings call transcripts, it'd be extremely obvious that TIGR was getting better because they just had their expenses lowered due to their new clearing facilities in Hong Kong. On the other hand, FUTU always traded at least high 10th in term of P/E when it was trading in the 70s. So in a direct comparison, TIGR is extremely undervalued to FUTU. I don't think I need to bring in US brokerage firms such as IBKR, Charles Schwab, or even Robinhood into comparison, it would only make the undervaluation more dramatic. So in a peer to peer comparison (but need to dig a little bit in the SEC filings and earnings), TIGR is extremely undervalued, so I assumed it would have more room to run than FUTU.
3. Market Hype and True Beneficiary: Market Hype is a little tricky to explain, because I did have to evaluate how much of an impact this Chinese new policy would have on the market to a certain degree. I will leave this factor out for now, just remember it's important. Turning to the true beneficiaries of this wave, it's very obvious that the trading volume had gone through the roof in China, in most of the Chinese markets, volume at least double or triple'd. As I mentioned before, people around the world can use TIGR broker to buy Hang Seng stocks (Hong Kong), since they mainly serve Mandarin or other Chinese speaking customers, they should at least be getting some very good short term boost on revenue on top of their already improving revenue right? This is probably the single most important factor that narrowed my initial picking into a group of 4 stocks only, which were: TIGR, FUTU, and LU (LU are sub lenders trading in 1-2s range, also in financial sector. I liked their valuation and stuff, but I was worried about their extreme low price per share not attracting many real/legit investors, also they were not the biggest beneficiary in comparison to brokers).
4. Information Mismatch: This applies to multiple aspects, the first aspect is language. When the news hit the tape, people who can read Chinese can obviously understand the changes better. However this is not the focus here, the 2nd factor is more crucial, it is more company related. TIGR trades in penny stock range (under $5), and it has not so straight forward share structure, also it's a foreign company that files 6K and 20F rather than the GAAP 10Q and 10K, its financial statements can be confusing to read at times. I have talked to some people who says ""oh look TIGR has over 2b shares outstanding and have a P/E of 70 or something"" while I already gradually exited most of my positions. But in reality, if one just hit Control-F and searched ""ordinary share"" in some of their 6Ks, or 20Fs, it's not hard to know that the ratio between ordinary shares and ADS/ADR is 15:1, and the true shares count for ADS is just 158m rather than over 2b. For P/E, I already mentioned before, the true P/E is in the mid-high singles. When there are so many confusing factors (which I only listed a few, but there are way more) out there plus it being a Chinese company in ""penny stock"" range, market need time to analyze and react. And in extreme cases, over confident short sellers would short too early when the share prices rises too fast, which is what I believed happened the past few days.
5. Preparation and Timing of the Trade: For preparation, the process is simple but highly repetitive and time consuming. I have personally spent many months and thousand of hours going through and potentially studying every ticker listed in the US market (which is almost 5k companies/stocks, skipped most obvious trash stocks/companies of course), and these obviously included all the Chinese companies listed in the US. I have a watch list of companies like TIGR with low valuation and other similar characteristics, it's basically just hours of research and study. But this is not the hard part, at least not for me. The real hard part is waiting for the right time, and right time only. In my TIGR trades, if I didn't get in on the very first day (9/25) or second day (since the second day is red), it's highly likely that I would not like the risk/reward on the 3rd day and missed this whole trade since it's moving so fast. This works both ways and in all of my other trades too. If I get in too early without waiting for catalyst, the stock usually would either drift lower or just trade within an insignificant range. If I get in too late (even just 2-3 days in most cases), the risk/reward become much worse, specially when using options with heavily increased IV and share prices.

So how did I execute my trades? Basically on the first day (9/25), I got shocked and not sure how to react initially. Then I quickly narrowed my picks to a group of 4 Chinese companies, TIGR, FUTU or LU, and I decided to use options because I thought this could be a pretty good asymmetrical risk/reward trade, and I only need to risk a small amount of my portfolio. Since the undervaluation for TIGR is so significant, broker being the biggest potential beneficiary, also dating back to 2020/2021, TIGR is more choppy when rising in comparison to FUTU, but it should get there eventually. LU are in low penny stock range (they are in sub lending business which I never liked in the first place, but they are in financial sector, which is positively impacted by the new policies). When stock prices are too low, the option pricing becomes very choppy, the spread is huge (at least 0.05 if I want to buy some meaningful amount). So I thought TIGR which at the time seemed to me the best choice available. This entire process of reading news and deciding to buy TIGR from the list of almost 300 Chinese stocks took me less than an hour, as I said before, although this news came as a surprise, I don't really need that much time going over these stocks because I already studied them before, and they either didn't move much, or drifted lower these years. The only new research I needed was to read recent filings/transcripts.

I bought 400 of $4 TIGR call expiring Nov 15/2024 when the stock was just below 4.1 on the first day, the average for the option was slightly higher than 0.4. Which was like 80-90% of the total trading volume on that particular contract that day. My thoughts were that the hype has already seen the initial effects, give it 50 days, it could potentially benefit from the huge trading volume change, and potentially catch real investors looking for cheap China related assets.

On the 2nd day, US listed Chinese ETFs and almost all of Chinese ADS/ADR tanked because they overshot too much on the 1st day, rising way above what the SSE index gained in China on the 1st day. The weird thing is, FUTU actually closed green that day, while TIGR dropped 3%. That got me thinking: ""I think I'm wrong, people would pay high premiums for high/top quality companies, and the valuation gap would almost always be there between TIGR and FUTU."" On this day, I bought 150 more $4 strike price TIGR contracts expiring January of 2026, they were bought at $1.15 each. My thoughts were to ""protect the losses"" of those 400 calls bought earlier. Because the company is growing, profit is going up, even without any near term boost impacts, the stock traded $5.72 for 52 weeks high, and it should at least trade somewhere near $6 some time in this more than 1 year period. Looking back at it, the trade itself wasn't that bad, but clearly it was somewhat impacted by the other trade earlier, which should be avoided tbh.

However on the 3rd day which got me back to my original thought and almost confirmed my thesis to a certain degree. TIGR rose 15% while FUTU gained less than 8%. I thought: ""yeah, TIGR will rise for sure, even though FUTU has the better quality here, but TIGR should eventually rise about the same amount of percentage as FUTU. Looking back at what they did back in 2020/2021, it's just TIGR would be more choppy."" Also on the 3rd day, I finally double confirmed my belief of brokers being the most beneficial group in this wave, at least initially, before any sector rotation. Because almost all of the brokers listed in China ran the most, they were all reaching their daily gain limit everyday, some rising 35%, and others rising 60-70% in the span of 3 days depending on their daily limit. But that's not all, the trading volume in China was so huge that the official Shanghai Exchange had issues processing orders for 2 hours, which is unheard of! I actually stayed up late that night watching the Shanghai Index, as I feel the euphoria of the traders in public text channels in China (just like stocktwits or similar stuff). This absolutely proved that any brokers who had many Chinese related assets would benefit huge in the short term. Moreover, TIGR, FUTU or any other similar broker can put out ""surprise"" press releases saying they got a huge trading activities increase anytime, which would further fuel the rally. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, or maybe it was me just being too stupid, I never thought of going more aggressive during trading hours knowing the new information (Actually I lied, it was just me playing World of Warcraft during the entire market hour like a douchebag). After the close of that day, I saw the $6 contract expiring Nov 15/2024 going for only 0.10 on the ask! Because of the information disconnection between Chinese traders and US traders, at that time I knew I missed a huge opportunity. Indeed in the hindsight, I lost a big potential gain.

Moving on to the 4th day, Sept 27, which is my ""hero day"", it had an early premarket high, then tanked in premarket, after it opens, it formed a double top and tanked all day. Although I just used ""pro technical words"" like double top and stuff, I think they are just non sense crap, at least in this case. Because it should move with the index, or with FUTU, if FUTU goes up, so should TIGR, which FUTU did go up that day for 5%+. In the meanwhile, I realized the huge trading volume on TIGR, also number of available shares to short were decreasing, then I realized that it must be a lot of retail shorting (specially with that double top technical crap in this case that day, without knowing shit about the fundamentals of the company). As I watched the stock tanking from 10%+ to breakeven on the day, and my options dropped even further, I knew my opportunity has finally came. I was so relieved that the market has given me the 2nd chance to correct yesterday's mistakes. I sold all of my 400 $4 contracts expiring Nov 15/2024 at a over 100% gain, some of my $4 contracts expiring 2026, bought 200 of $5 contracts expiring January of 2025, then I bought 2000 (Yes 2000) of $6 expiring Nov 15/2024. My first buy on those $6s were 0.20, but as the stock drifted lower all the way to -5%, majority of my purchases were in the 0.15s. Although not as cheap as the day before, but hey, at least I got a second chance. Because of the euphoria I was seeing in the Chinese market, I added another $15k or so to complete the purchase of these 2000 $6 contracts. But due to the risky nature of options, specially this short term one, I won't let my exposure get out of whack, so I mainly just put back all my previous gains from earlier options with just a little extra addition of funds. Up to this point, my buys has been complete.

Now for my sales, since the stock rose double digits everyday for the last week, I pretty much been selling everyday, with the initial sale in the mid/low 5s for less than a dollar a contract, all the way up to low 6s when it reached high 11s or low 12s in the last trading hour on Friday. I never thought it could rise this high this fast, my original goal was more towards $7-8 near the end of this bull run. On a side note, I did make a stupid hedge later which costs me about just six figure in total. With the short borrowing fees going from 0% to 6% atm, this is a turning into a very crowded trade, last week's meteoric rise involved a lot of short covers in my eyes. When trades get crowded, options become extremely expensive, there will be times where the stock goes completely insane (just anything during Covid era really), but more frequently these trades don't work out in my favor, so I just completely cut them when I feel the crowdiness. Now with the entire position of 2000 $6 contracts sold, I'm only left with the 200+ longer term position left on my $4, $5 strikes, which I just completely hedged by shorting TIGR overnight in the high 13s (which turned out to be too early, again. Who knows if it will reach completely insane numbers like back in Covid times). I will be back to sniper mode and patiently wait for the next bull run, be it a stock on my watchlist or a sector wide hype.

In summary, this entire trade netted me about 1.1M in Canadian dollars. Because this is really an unexpected event to begin with, (unlike other catalysts such as earnings, at least we know the date beforehand) I'm quite happy with how I dealt with the situation with almost no preparation. I have uploaded some images about my account gains and some trade statements, the percentage gain is completely out of whack because I took a break from trading for couple months after a string of stupid losses. (Portfolio wise they didn't hurt that much, but they were mentally frustrating) When I fund the account again with a small initial amount, the funding get calculated into gains as well. The real gaining percentage is more like 2600%-2700% rather than tens of millions.

To whoever wants to know a bit more about my trading style similar to what I did on this trade. I read at least 100+ books on trading and found Jessie C Stine's ""Insider buy Superstocks"" and Cornwall Capital's option strategies from ""The Big Shorts"" the most useful. My trading styles are very different than theirs, but I derived most of my trading methods from their general ideas. I left many hints and trails on how I would structure my trade from thought process to building a position then finally exiting in this example. It's my first post on reddit, I just wrote wherever I was thinking, so the ordering or even the logic itself will be very messy or incomplete in many places, but overall this write up should roughly explain the trade in a fairly straight way.

In the end, I want to do a shoutout to DL12345 for encouraging me to write about this trade.

It could potentially remove the biggest dark cloud over Hims and Hers 

The -47% decline in HIMS stock was not because HIMS didn't do well but rather because of the market's worry about the durability of the GLP-1 business and the potential legal risks it posed. 

The decline started on 6/20/24 resultant of Lilly filing more lawsuits to curb the sales of counterfeit Mounjaro.


 This is a extremely good news. This is also a result of SCOTUS overturning the Chevron Doctrine - it took away power from Federal agencies from the like of FDA and put it in the hand of courts. If FDA wants to be pressured by Lilly and drop a hammer on HIMS...the FDA can get sued.

I believe this is what we are seeing here.

When HIMS launched Semaglutide GLP-1 on 5/20/2024, it also mentioned it will launch Tirzepatide later this year. The legal actions from Lilly is the reason that market think HIMS' growth upside is capped. HIMS grew 46% without GLP-1, 52% with GLP-1. This is the difference between flat growth vs growth re-accleration. The difference matters.

The market may see this new development as ""Lilly can no longer clip HIMS' wings""...same applies to Novo & Semaglutide that HIMS does sell.

Be prepared if HIMS launch compounded Tirzepatide on the back of this news. It will likely send the shares rocket up. 

This might be the legal strategy Andrew and company said they were working on.

This news paired with a doubling in Network traffic from April-Sep 2024 as well as its ability to cover a need for a large basis of the population gives me confidence in its strength and ability to develop forward despite being a relatively young company (of only 7 years)

What is happening in the uranium sector? ,209,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fy82qc/what_is_happening_in_the_uranium_sector/,74,1728308942.0,"Hi everyone,

**A summery of a couple important points**

The uranium sector is in a growing global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple of years time, while:

* recently the biggest uranium producing country of the world, Kazakhstan, made a 17% cut in the previously promised production level for 2025 and also hinting on lower production levels for 2026 and beyond than previously hoped.
* followed by additional production cuts from other uranium producers (Uranium mining is hard)
* recently Putin started the threat of soon restricting uranium deliveries to the West, meaning Russian uranium, Russian enriched uranium, uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that goes through Russia to the port of Saint Petersburg.
* followed by Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) stating that uranium deliveries to the West has become difficult and could become even more difficult in the future (--> Putin's threat)
* Microsoft paying for 100% of electricity from the Three Mile Island reactor they asked Constellation to restart in 2028 = That's unexpected additional uranium demand for delivery in 2025.
* Uranium demand is price inelastic
* The inventory created in 2011-2017 (when uranium sector was in oversupply) that helped to solve the structural global deficit starting early 2018, is now depleted! (Confirmed by UxC)
* Followed by additional production start delays (Zuuvch Ovoo, Orano)

**A couple points more in detail:**

**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.

**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future

**C.** A month ago Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond

A. B & C are explained in my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f77a6h/17\_cut\_in\_expected\_production\_2025\_in\_kazakhstan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f77a6h/17_cut_in_expected_production_2025_in_kazakhstan/)

**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce**. Meaning that they will soon all together try to buy uranium through the illiquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket (Uranium One) has less uranium to sell now.

And the less uranium producers deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket themself.

There is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy a significant volume of uranium in the illiquide spotmarket during the new high season in the uranium sector.

And before that production cut announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:

page 10 of this presentation: [https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf)



**D. Now: additional important delay in world uranium production => Orano is in trouble to honor their LT uranium supply commitments to their clients**

The Zuuvch Ovoo uranium mine of Orano is delayed by at least 2 years!

This was an important uranium project.

That's a loss of 14Mlb! (2\*7Mlb/y)

[Source: @z\_axis\_capital, by comparing 2 announcements in 2024, latest yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/brv9rvb59ctd1.jpg?width=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=613d25abe3916402e053bf4de3eeb1bd5822c7d7)

Orano is a major uranium producers. They have a serious problem.

They lost uranium production in Niger in 2023/2024, they lost the Imouraren uranium project in Niger in 2024, and now this delay in production start of Zuuvch uranium mine.

Orano already had to buy uranium in the spotmarket to be able to honor their supply commitements. But now they will have to buy even more in the very tight uranium spotmarket

**E. 2 triggers (=> Break out of uranium price starting this week imo)**

a) This week (October 1st) the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.

With all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.

b) The last \~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.

Now there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying

The upward pressure on the uranium spot and LT price is about to increase significantly

Just after October 1st, we got the first information of a lot of RFP's being launched!

**F. LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**

Although the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.

Here a link to the Uranium LT price: [https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price)

The global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!

During the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.

In the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price

The official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.

**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**

=> an average of 105 USD/lb

While the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb. Today TradeTech announced a new uranium LT price of 82 USD/lb, while Cameco announces a 81.5 LT uranium price of end September 2024.

By consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster coming weeks with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher in coming months compared to the 81.5 USD/lb of end September 2024.

Here is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers (look at my comment)

**G. Russia is preparing a long list of export curbs**

After the announcement of the huge (17%) cut in the planned production for 2025 and beyond of the biggest uranium producer of the world (Kazakhstan: \~45% of world production), now Putin asked his people to look into the possibilities to restrict some commodities export to the Western countries, explicitely mentioning uranium

[https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm)

**H. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started a week ago is now accelerating (some stakeholders have been frontrunning the 2 triggers starting previous week)**

Although the uranium LT price is much more important for the sector, most investors look at the uranium spotprice.

Here a link to the uranium spotprice on Numerco: [https://numerco.com/NSet/aCNSet.html](https://numerco.com/NSet/aCNSet.html)

**The uranium lbs available for spotselling are very scarce now, while all major uranium producers are short uranium and need to find lbs elsewhere (spot) to be able to honor their supply commitments**

Causes:

a) Uranium One (100% production from Kazakhstan) producing less uranium than previously hoped by many (Utilities, Intermediaries, other producers). So less primary production to sell in spot

b) Inventory X, created in 2011-2017 that solved the annual primary deficit since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted. (Confirmed by UxC)

c) Utilities and Intermediaries increasing their minimum operational inventory levels due to the growing uranium supply insecurity => With supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others

Investors underestimate the impact of Russian threat alone. The threat alone (without effectively going through with it) is sufficient for utilities to go from supply security to supply insecurity.

Utilities and Intermediaries trade uranium between each other. But with supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others

**The last commercially available lbs will become unavailable before even being sold!**

**I. Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). **Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.**

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)

The uranium LT price just increased to 81.50 USD/lb, while uranium spotprice started to increase the last couple of trading days of previous week.

Uranium spotprice is now at 82.63 USD/lb

A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at 27.60 CAD/share or 20.33 USD/sh represents an uranium price of 82.63 USD/lb

For instance, before the production cuts announced by Kazakhstan and before Putin's threat too restrict uranium supply to the West, Cantor Fitzgerald estimated that the uranium spotprice will reach 120 USD/lb, 130 USD/lb in 2025 and 140 USD/lb in 2026. Knowing a couple important factors in the sector today (UxC confirming that inventory X is indeed depleted now) find this estimate for 2024/2025 modest, but ok.

An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.00 CAD/sh or \~29.60 USD/sh.

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

**J.** **A couple uranium sector ETF's**:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector

I posting now, in the early days of the high season in the uranium sector that started in September and that will now hit the accelerator (Oct 1st), and not 2 months later when we will be well in the high season

Hello,

With the rise of generative AI, more and more people are using it instead of searching on Google. Gemini falls short compared to its competitors, and it seems that Google is much further behind in the AI race than it appeared to be a year ago.

Furthermore, AI-powered engines are emerging, and they are already working well today. Take Perplexity, for example: it is a well-functioning product, and it can only improve in the coming months.

Also, OpenAI is about to launch its own search engine.

In addition, Google‚Äôs results are filled with AI-written articles of little value that rank on the first page but shouldn‚Äôt even be in the top positions.

Google is losing searches and impressions on AdSense because people are tired of ad-filled blogs with terrible user experience. Gemini is not on the same level as Claude or GPT.

I don‚Äôt understand why people think Google‚Äôs stock is a bargain. To me, it‚Äôs a fallen giant.

TL;DR: Google is falling behind in the AI race, with competitors like Perplexity and OpenAI leading the way. Its search results are filled with low-quality AI-written content, and users are moving away from it."

Is INTC undervalued ?,113,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fye8fl/is_intc_undervalued/,108,1728324268.0,"**Valuation Analysis of Intel Corporation**

Intel Corporation [(NASDAQ: INTC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC/) has long been a key player in the semiconductor industry, but recent market developments and the rise of competitors like AMD and Nvidia have caused its stock to significantly underperform relative to its peers. As of Q2 2024, Intel‚Äôs total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel‚Äôs growth potential.

|Company|Market Cap (Billion $)|Net Assets (Billion $)|Price to Net Asset Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Intel|95|91|1.04|
|AMD|266|56.5|4.71|
|Nvidia|3,000|58.15|51.58|

**Understanding Intel‚Äôs Valuation**

The Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential.

Several factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Additionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands.

A key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market.

Moreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning.

**Conclusion**

In summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Now I've read about potential stock dilution, seeing as I'm up a few percentage luckily, would it be prudent to just sell now and then wait for the inevitable 10 billion stock dilution?

 Because it is either BA dilutes stock to raise equity or take on more debt and become junk status. Both are bad for investors but the latter is much worse.

Would the play here buy back in post stock dilution?

I can see a 10 to 20 percent drop after stock dilution.

What gives on MBS funds‚Ä¶,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fywu43/what_gives_on_mbs_funds/,25,1728384509.0,"Back when ‚Äò08 happened everyone lost their homes and the funds were full of shit mortgages. But the rebound of MBS funds like MBB only went down 3.5% and when it rebounded went up 7% in ‚Äò09. But when Covid happened MBB and other funds tanked. MBB crashed 22% over the course of three years. 

All MBS charts are showing a reverse head and shoulders but still deep red. How can the government say we are in the most productive stable economy when mortgages are at an all time low according to these funds. If people had money they‚Äôd be buying homes left and right yet all we see are companies like AMH making great returns and their business model is to buy up newly built suburbs and rent out the housing at insane prices. 

Has america sold out because MBS‚Äôs failed in ‚Äò08 that the government has allowed a transition to a rent only society. Letting big money play with the risk of home ownership. 

What are your thoughts on MBS‚Äôs and the current housing market. Will we go back to a society that will allow gen z to start buying homes or will they forever be stuck paying rent? "

‚Ä¶ Let me tell you a story about sexy distributors:

Distributors are amazing stocks. I‚Äôm looking for the next group of smaller cap industrial distributor stocks that can replace the existing group of distributors that are now at high multiples.

distributors that i love but are too expensive include:

Ferguson $FERG +140% in 5yr, 23x PE, 40bn mkt cap

WWGrainger $GWW +240% - 27x , $50bn

Fastenal $FAST +90%, 35x, $40bn

There are others, like chemical distributors like IMCD in Europe.

Why i love distributors:
1) Capital light
2) often consolidating fragmented markets through small roll-up m&a (often mom and pop competitors)
3) Route density is a great and easy way to improve margins. 
4) often distribute critical parts that are also low cost. customers willing to pay for good service

I‚Äôm looking for the next group of industrial distributors. $BECN , $BLDR $WCC all seem interesting.. but BECN feels like by far the best asymetric risk reward.

Beacon Roofing $BECN $6bn and on 14x PE
Beacon 

1) Capital light distributor of roofing and other housebuilding products
2) rolling up fragmented market through small m&a
3) technology is becoming differentiator vs small competitors
4) Brad Jacob‚Äôs $QXO is looking to do a deal in the building products space. hopefully BECN isn‚Äôt the target
5) ongoing buyback (on its way to becoming a stock cannibal)
6) near term beneficiary from hurricanes.. (stock up 7% today)

obviously my thesis isn‚Äôt based on hurricanes and i hate to see any loss of life or property. but unfortunately hurricane revenue will highlight that BECN is a quality asset"

Is it time to board the Bitcoin hype train? What‚Äôs the current state of Bitcoin miners?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fz3pai/is_it_time_to_board_the_bitcoin_hype_train_whats/,84,1728404149.0,"Disclaimer:

I own MARA based on my prediction and MSTR based on it‚Äôs institutional support. What I have listed below is for the purpose of discussion and not financial advice. Ideally I get to hear some solid opinions on the matter, which is the reason for this post.

Introduction:

The much anticipated Bitcoin ‚ÄûUptober‚Äú has arguably been less explosive than expected. Maybe it was already priced in due to Bitcoins performance in September (usually a red month but not this year). Maybe Bitcoin just needs to warm up after its heavy consolidation period. Maybe there are other stakes at play for the delayed boom‚Ä¶ Nevertheless, Bitcoin seems to finally be gaining some momentum, and Bitcoin related stocks like MSTR are starting to move (+70% in in the last 30 days), showing a growing market interest in the sector.

Bitcoin and Mining stocks: 

I don‚Äôt think a lot needs to be said about MSTR. Michael Saylors vision of MSTR is clear as he keeps buying and promoting Bitcoin. I believe MSTR will be a standard play for a lot of institutions this cycle, as seen with its current move to the upside.

On to the more controversial topic of crypto miners like MARA and RIOT:

These stocks have been friends of mine in the past. For one, their market caps are relatively low, making them quite volatile during hype periods. On top of that, they are shorted against, creating massive opportunities for short squeezes (I don‚Äôt think I need to explain to y‚Äôall the possible upsides of that‚Ä¶).

However, one point that keeps getting brought up is that many of these companies will dilute their shares (sell extra shares) to raise more cash, which in turn decreases the underlying share value of shareholders. Although I agree that this isn‚Äôt ideal, I think it is important to mention that this is mainly done to buy more Bitcoin before possible major Bitcoin moves (as MARA and MSTR do). So whether this makes you a fan or a hater of the stock is up to you really. But I believe that if someone is going to buy into a Bitcoin stocks purely for the boom, then this should be seen as bullish because in my opinion, a company holding more Bitcoin will be more attractive to other investors. 

So yea, Bitcoin miners are a rollercoaster. But can‚Äôt that be advantageous?

Possibly relevant timestamps:

I know I know‚Ä¶ past crypto cycles are not recipes for future cycles. But the cycles have retreated several times of bitcoins lifetime, hence my short summary below. 

1. October 2024: 

As explained, October generally is the best performing month (historically speaking) for Bitcoin throughout the whole year. November and December are also very profitable months, and the rally tends to extend past this. During this time, larger Bitcoin related stocks MSTR also perform very well. 

In the last cycle 4 years ago, MSTR grew 166% from October 1st to December 31st. Its rally topped out early February the following year with a return of over 800%‚Ä¶ 

Bitcoin miner MARA grew 450% from October 1st to December 31st. Its rally topped out mid Feb the following year with a return of over 2500%. RIOT performed similarly.

2. December 2024

This upcoming December, the implementation phase of MiCAR (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) is set to end. It will be followed by an 18 month transitional period, in which all entities providing crypto asset services much be compliant with international regulations. This will improve the image Bitcoin and crypto in terms of regulatory safety, and the effects can already be seen with major institutional involvement. Whether it becomes a short term catalyst is to be seen, but for Bitcoin HODLers, this is essential.

3. 2025 and onward 

Obviously, it is very likely that the Bitcoin hypetrain will be followed by another crypto winter. In the last cycle, stocks like MSTR saw this winter following its peak early Feb. RIOT faced a similar trend. MARA, on the other hand, settled at a new ATH in early April 2021 (+5000% from October 2020), and topped out even further the following November 2021 (+7500% from October 2020). Based on historical data, it can be argued that Bitcoin and Bitcoin related stocks will see further and major upside in 2025.

Prediction:

So what is my non-professional and totally degenerate expectation of Bitcoin related stocks?

First off, I think that all stocks with major holdings in Bitcoin will do well in the early stages of the cycle. So this would be the likes of MSTR. I also believe that miners will continue to lag behind at first, but will eventually catch up and even outperform Bitcoin and larger Bitcoin stocks, simply because of their lower market caps. In terms of when I expect the top to occur, it is hard to say‚Ä¶ I will definitely be eyeing December as a first milestone. If it feels like the MiCAR regulations were a catalyst for Bitcoin, it could be that Bitcoin slows in Jan and Feb. Next I will be watching end of January and early Feb, as this clearly was a major timestamp in last years cycle. Following February I expect some cooling and a bit of selling. In the beginning and throughout next summer, I will pay attention to how momentum is moving Bitcoin stocks and potentially swing trade. I will be looking for Bitcoin stocks which implement a HODL strategy.

Sadly, I don‚Äôt think we will reach the percentage gains that we did in the last cycle. Another gain of 7500% for MARA would but it at over $1100 per share. Although I would be ecstatic about this, I just don‚Äôt see it as realistic‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs hard to think about why to sell when everyone is telling you to buy, but I am of the opinion that is when it should be most deeply considered.

AMD has been my most profitable investment of the past 5 years, having risen 800% since purchased in August of 2018. For most investors (including myself), it‚Äôs difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I‚Äôve begun doing over the past two weeks.

https://preview.redd.it/1mrdxxmcsetd1.jpg?width=1582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99dacab7094cfcdf83b92c7aeb6bccb4cb712d0b

I had high hopes for AMD this year, but it‚Äôs my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both¬†[client](https://youtu.be/QB1u4mjpBQI?si=aO3PiV0MPfbaneGQ)¬†and¬†[data center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h0wBn2L-FU)), as well as¬†[proprietary silicon](https://aws.amazon.com/silicon-innovation/)¬†from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see¬†[Why I Got Nvidia Wrong](https://dragdeninvest.substack.com/p/why-i-got-nvidia-wrong)). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC ([TSM¬†2.61%‚Üë](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/TSM)), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago).

On the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It‚Äôs not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years.

**Why This Take Could Be Wrong:**  
There is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia‚Äôs only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have \~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies¬†[reliant on Taiwan](https://substack.com/@dragdeninvest/p-138866297)."

Despite ridiculous P/E‚Äôs the risk of not buying outweighs that of buying.,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fxog3z/despite_ridiculous_pes_the_risk_of_not_buying/,85,1728242401.0,"
Some  believe we‚Äôre seeing a repeat of 2021, when price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios seemed irrelevant and the market was overly optimistic. While the current market does have a feeling of a ridiculous bullish sentiment( caught, cough NVDIA ) , the macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from 2021.

Today, things seem to once again be irrational, I agree to a certain limit . It‚Äôs difficult when even stocks  like Costco  have fan boys attempting to downplay the importance of valuation, P/E since they are ridiculously high, ratios still matter. 

HOWEVER.  Today is much more different then 2021 

Please  consider the broader context. For instance, the ongoing geopolitical tensions, including wars, have different implications now than in 2021. The Russia Ukrainian war was the only ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù  that did not see the market gain  some short time after.  Every other invasion was a buying opportunity.  Why ?

Back in 2021, the Federal Reserve was tightening monetary policy, which restrained the market‚Äôs ability to recover from geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This time, we are in a much more stable environment, characterized by a decrease in interested rates with a robust American economy,  the exact opposite of 2021 

- Strong job reports
- Declining interest rates
- Falling inflation
- Invasion signal a buying opportunity the Middle East tensions have had zero impacts. 
- Oil is nowhere near as impactful as it once  was in its golden days 
 - Emerging technological advancements related to AI and robotics

These factors contribute to a sense of American economic exceptionalism. So, while it‚Äôs natural to be cautious, there are strong reasons to remain optimistic about stock market opportunities. 


I believe that the risk of missing out on buying shares outweighs the risk of investing during market dips. Just like the major tech companies have invested heavily in areas like NVIDIA and chips, they ultimately need to deliver profits. However, the real danger lies in not investing at all.

Hurricane Play,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fynu8t/hurricane_play/,15,1728349444.0,With the increasing frequency and severity of these major destructive hurricanes there has to be a way to profit off of it.  Insurance companies paid out roughly 50-65 billion dollars in damages to policy holders from Hurricane Ian alone.  The lion's share of this is going to be real estate properties destroyed.  All of these will be rebuilt or built bigger and more expensive than before.  This is undeniably going to hurt the insurance companies where it hurts.  The obvious answer is to short insurance companies and sell puts on building materials companies.   What is the consensus?
Robotaxis will not be a trillion dollar business,3902,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fww48q/robotaxis_will_not_be_a_trillion_dollar_business/,2145,1728150692.0,"I fail to see the trillions business that Musk and all the analysts parroting for robotaxis.  It‚Äôs a stupid idea built on fantasies.  Here‚Äôs my argument:

1. Every single Tesla owner I know won‚Äôt lend out their cars. The lending out is the stupidest idea ever.  Every car owner I know won't lend out their car either.  Tesla will have to run their own fleet which will increase costs, maintenance etc.
2. Percentage of people willing to take a robotaxi daily are low; like Uber.  At best; it‚Äôs will be an Uber like service with limited use cases:  Traveling, airports, designated drivers etc.
3. Costs are astronomical when you add up all your small daily trips.  Two kids household in the US suburbs with limited public transportation.  I take approximately 8-10 roundtrips a day, sometimes more on the weekends.

For example: $7 per trip according to Musk: commute(2), kids school(2), kids activities(2-4), leisure or Starbucks or McDonald‚Äôs or family visits(2). $60-80 per day= $1500+ per month and that‚Äôs assuming every trip is $7.  Why not just own a car at    that price?

Edit: I forgot to add the emotional, pride and freedom of owning a car.  US consumers love their cars and trucks more so than guns.  A lot of people will die rather than give up their cars.

Edit: All the pro responses are parroting the same spiel that Musk, Woods and analysts are spewing.  No examples, no numbers, no market.  It's ""Believe me, it will happen"".  Same as the metaverse, Vision Pro, 3D printing, 3D TV which were all touted as the next big thing but ended being a limited market.

Their car and energy businesses will be fine but the trillions robotaxi business has always been a fantasy.   This ain‚Äôt about the stock price or where it‚Äôs going.  TsLA never traded on fundamentals anyway.  "

Oxy - Buffet buying hand over fist.  Great balance sheet for a great energy play. 

Lulu- low end luxury clothing that China recently discovered. Also a strong balance sheet with a very low P/E.  I see it doubling.

Nvidia CEO's bombshell raises the bar for the stock,300,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fx1mf4/nvidia_ceos_bombshell_raises_the_bar_for_the_stock/,87,1728165983.0,"# Sounds like great news to me. Let's hope NVDA & NVDL Moon soon!

[Nvidia CEO's bombshell raises the bar for the stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceos-bombshell-raises-bar-130300278.html)

Demand is ""insane,"" Nvidia‚Äôs chief executive Jensen Huang recently said. Major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud are integrating Blackwell into their infrastructure to support high-performance AI workloads.

[**Related: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just told investors what‚Äôs next for the AI chipmaker**](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/nvidias-jensen-huang-addressed-three-big-questions-about-ai-future)

Oracle¬†[announced](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-to-invest-in-ai-and-cloud-computing-in-malaysia-2024-10-02/)¬†on October 2 that it would need 131,072 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs as part of a $6.5 billion investment to establish a new public cloud region in Malaysia, another proof of a strong need for advanced AI processing capabilities.

Blackwell is a platform Nvidia launched in March that allows organizations to run real-time generative AI on models with trillions of parameters. These large language models are trained on extensive datasets to understand and generate responses in human language.

‚ÄúBlackwell is in full production,‚Äù Huang said in an interview with CNBC. ‚ÄúThe demand for Blackwell is insane. Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.‚Äù

Nvidia's stock has surged by over 150% this year, following an impressive 240% gain in 2023.

Hyperscaler buyers like Amazon¬†¬†([**AMZN**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN))¬†, Microsoft¬†¬†([**MSFT**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT))¬†, and Alphabet¬†¬†([**GOOGL**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL))¬†¬†are expected to spend around $160 billion in 2024 on AI infrastructure, according to Bernstein analysts. The cost of Blackwell is expected to range between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit.

Huang emphasized the importance of continuous updates to Nvidia‚Äôs AI infrastructure, with the company releasing new platforms annually. ‚ÄúIf we can increase the performance, like we've done for Hopper and Blackwell ... we're effectively increasing the revenue or throughput for our customers on these infrastructures by a couple to three times each year,"" Huang added.

# Nvidia's financial performance exceeds expectations

Nvidia‚Äôs latest earnings report further solidifies its strong position in the AI market.

On August 28, the company posted earnings per share of 68 cents, beating Wall Street expectations of 64 cents. Revenue hit $30.04 billion, up 122%, surpassing the anticipated $28.7 billion.

Nvidia forecasts $32.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter, an 80% increase from last year.

[**Related: Veteran trader targets Nvidia as shares slide**](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/veteran-trader-targets-nvidia-as-shares-slide)

Nvidia plans to ship Blackwell GPUs to clients in Q4 of this year, with a consumer release expected in 2025. ‚ÄúIn the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue,‚Äù Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said during the August earnings call.

Nvidia's stock has surged by over 150% this year, following an impressive 240% gain in 2023. The company is now worth over $3 trillion, one of the most valuable companies in the world just behind Apple and Microsoft.

# Analyst sees ""compelling"" growth and valuation for Nvidia

JPMorgan remains confident in Nvidia‚Äôs outlook, maintaining an overweight rating and a $155 price target, [thefly.com](http://thefly.com) reported.

""Nvidia remains on track to ship its next-generation Blackwell graphic processing unit platform in high volume production in Q4,"" the analyst tells investors in a research note on October 2, adding that investors do not have to pay too much attention to the¬†recent sell-side noise on rackscale portfolio changes.

Nvidia is halting development of its dual-rack 72-way GB200-based NVL36√ó2,¬†TF International Securities's analyst¬†Ming-Chi Kuo said on Oct. 1.

Last month, Bank of America reiterated a buy rating and $165 price target on Nvidia, which the firm also calls its top sector pick.

The firm warned of several near-term headwinds, including Blackwell's delay and gross margin pressure, a potential DOJ probe, competition, AI monetization, cloud capex, weak seasonality, and the U.S. elections.

The firm highlights Nvidia's ""compelling growth"" and says upcoming supply chain updates in the next few weeks will confirm Blackwell product shipments, which they see as the main factor for a recovery."

"I lost $1,030,220.81 in the stock market.",11822,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fwcw2y/i_lost_103022081_in_the_stock_market/,3353,1728084451.0,"I've held this in long enough. The shame, guilt, lies. Pretending to be cool and knowing what the fuck I'm talking about. I've been holding this in for years. I've cried and cried and cried. I'm fed up with my bitch behavior. It's time to fucking take things into my own hands and change. I'm not stopping, I'm going to gain this all back the slow, and right way. Here's my story.

In 2019 I learned about the stock market. Like a responsible retail investor, I created baskets and diversified my equity investments.

In 2020, I learned about options.

My first gamble was a meme stock I found on WSB that rhymes with Ped Pad Peyon. That was the start of my entire $1M loss and life downfall.

It felt so good to see those big spikes in gains.

But it also felt like the end of the world when it all went to $0.

For some reason, I always came back. I tasted the forbidden fruit, and was addicted.

Fast forward two years, I needed a source for more trading capital - I sold my house and car, maxed out credit cards, borrowed from the bank, and lenders. I lied to family/friends to get money, and worked odd jobs that were shameful.

My wife who I'd been with for 12 years left me, we didn't sign a prenup so there was that whole process...then she took custody of the kids.

Sure, I lost $1,030,220.81. But the worst part of it all, is I lost loved ones, every friend in my life, and every single asset I owned. I cried like a fucking bitch for days on end, slept on benches, backyards, and under bridges.

I managed to save up some money, and am now living on my own, in a one-bedroom apartment.

I know it I can do this. I know I can make it all back. I've heard stories and seen people do it. I understand all the technical analysis, indicators, price action, gamma exposure, OI, risk-free interest, blah blah fucking blah. I know it all. What made me lose it all wasn't my understanding of the markets, it was my ego, my greed, and lack of discipline. My psyche.

I've spent the last 2 yrs dedicating myself to mastering every technical aspect of the market. I've met 10 figure retail investors, hedgefund managers, and everyone in between. Really dedicated myself to learning the markets. Most importantly, I've made good progress mastering my emotions. I've even gone on months without masturbating. I needed to model a stimulus that was just as rewarding as gambling.

I'm here to show that I can gradually get out of this hell-hole.

I've managed to trade back up to $25k, and in the last week I made $14k (options + futures). I will get back to $1M. I'm just here to prove to the world and myself that this isn't over.

Is it the most hedged / low risk decision? Fuck no. The degen surely lives on inside me. But I've tamed it. I guess if you're looking for entertainment, or a person to root for, you can find me on X. Username is lost1million. I'll try to give periodic updates here as well.

This is pretty much it for me. Here we go.

P.S. Please don't report me to the suicide prevention. While I appreciate the sympathy, the messages I get are quite annoying. I will be fine. I am fine.

Time to place your bets on $SAVA,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fxn4nj/time_to_place_your_bets_on_sava/,40,1728239044.0,"Let me start by saying, this is **NOT** a meme stock, as some of you may believe.  
  
**Why you should bet on SAVA**  
  
- Currently is Phase 3, readout to come by late November/early December. Data in previous Phases lead one to be optimistic to a positive Phase 3 outcome.  
  
- Richard Barry, formerly a Director of the company has taken over as CEO since the former CEO Remi Barbier resigned. Barry has stabilized the company and helped legitimize the company.  
  
- SAVA has settled with the SEC and separated themselves from Dr. Wang. The focus is now on the success of the drug and it‚Äôs roll out if approved.  
  
**What the FUDsters spew**  
  
- The bears will continue to point to ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù data by Dr Wang and how supposedly crooked Barbier is. Up to this point, that has just proven to be accusations and nothing concrete has been proven.  
  
- The amount of hit pieces and trolls on internet forums tells you all you need to know. If it truly was a scam, why even bother with the hit pieces. It will fail on it‚Äôs merits.  
  
- Every time positive data has been released, subsequently there is a short attack mixed with a FUD article that is released. This is clear manipulation and coordination by the powers that be.  
  
IMO, there is too much to gain or lose on this stock, and therefore there is a battle right now on the narrative of the company. The FDA had continued to allow SAVA to keep their trials going(despite challenges from the FUDsters to shut them down) and the company has done their best to remain quiet about the FUD. We will know in about 8 weeks who is right, and who is wrong. Time to place your bets."

- Food is mediocre at best, pretty bland. Would rather eat most other places or fast food
- Typical consumer seems to be older white generation, which is declining.

Intel stock Short term and long-term pros and cons,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fwjhl5/intel_stock_short_term_and_longterm_pros_and_cons/,26,1728106831.0,"TLDR: Any short term bull run will be up to good news that is difficult to predict. As Intel will likely underperform until their longterm goals pay off I believe the stock will continue to fall unless there is good news like alot of Gaudi3 sales/preorders. Gaudi 3 is lower performance than Nvidias newest ai chip though.

Long term-

Everything Intel is doing are long term investments that will only pay off 2-5 yrs from now. Building fab projected to take 2 yrs, 18A architecture 1 yr to begin production but will require another year for mass production,14A 3 yrs. These projects has high risk of being delayed.

Short term-

On the short term, great news that has yet to happen is Intel showing progress on using their new High NA EUV Lithography machine, improving issues like low output. This machine is more advanced than what TSMC has and is the one lead intel has over TSMC.

The best news possible in the short term for Intel would be TSMC being attacked by China. This would easily lead to Intel tripling in value as TSMC's main operations are landlocked in [Taiwan.Global](http://Taiwan.Global) Guardian experts put the likelihood of an all-out invasion at around 35%. Smaller scale escalations like interupting Taiwans trade will also greatly improve nana's position. Chinese military are already being accused of intentionally ramming into Philippine ships.

Long term potential could be Astronomical if Intel succeeds in their reversal but competitors are also improving. Nvidia's Ai Chips for example are improving at a faster rate than Intel, making them unlikely to catch up in that area. However, their head start on the High NA EUV machine could make it possible to jump the gap against Nvidia. Tesla already thinking of ordering thousands of Nvidia's next gen AI chip set for 2025/26, Intel still has a very strong balance sheet with a large amount of equity, but debt is increasing at an alarming rate and there's rumors intel accounting methods are made to favor their books.

In INTC I trust,257,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fw14ev/in_intc_i_trust/,215,1728053722.0,"I've shifted my entire S&P 500 holdings into Intel, and here's why:

The AI Revolution:  
 NVIDIA currently dominates the AI technology landscape, and that‚Äôs indisputable. Their unmatched tech and visionary leadership have set the bar high. However, with the U.S. aiming to maintain its global leadership, relying on a single company for AI tech could become a security risk and a bottleneck in innovation.

Why Intel Could Be the Game-Changer?  
Intel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips.   
Enter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel‚Äôs stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down.

Government Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race.

Positive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance.

Diamond Hands Ready: This isn't just a strategy; it‚Äôs a calculated move anticipating a shift in the tech landscape. Intel could lead the next wave of AI innovation.

I need some advice on which trading session to focus on. I've been trading Forex for a while, and it works well for me since I can trade the London session, which opens at 9:00 AM my time. This fits perfectly with my schedule because I have a pretty quiet job, so I can focus on trading while working.

Recently, though, I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people switching to futures, especially on CME, where the session opens at 3:30 PM. That‚Äôs right after my work, but I usually go to the gym around that time and I generally have less energy for trading later in the day. I could rearrange my routine, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth it.

What do you think? Is it better to stick with Forex, where I can trade more calmly during my work hours, or should I shift things around and give futures a try? Has anyone here made the switch from Forex to futures, and what was your experience like?

Thanks for any input!"

1. The Chinese government gives money to companies to buyback their own stocks at a sweet 1.75%  interest rate 
2. Well what if the company sucks, so buying back their own shares means they could lose more money right? Wrong  
3. The government will give 'em puts against their own company stocks, up to the amount borrowed. So if the stock drops, the company is covered. 
4. Naturally, the companies that benefit the most from all this are those that can put up collateral 
5. And so who are those? The ones with the best cash on their balance sheets - JD, PDD, BABA, and many others

Most people underestimate all big narratives, and trends last way longer than you'd expect. This seems like the early days of Apple when they first announced their buyback back in 2012. It is up 15X since then!

The housing market will soon start correcting.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fx9gdj/the_housing_market_will_soon_start_correcting/,99,1728192549.0,"Obviously this is not financial advice. This is all conjecture with no dd done to even confirm my assumptions and I'm somewhat of a tard. Also I've been in the housing market for about 4 years and have been wrong every step of the way so maybe there's a bit of wishful thinking.

Yet I'm convinced that the housing market is about to correct. Hard.

1. We all remember 2021 and the absolute buying spree caused by the record low interest rates. And with interest rates starting to be lowered most analysts expect housing sales to start back picking up. But for one I think that the record low rates of 2021- 2023 caused a pull forward effect of purchasing activity. These really were all time low rates and everyone with means we're buying and bidding prices up. Now I think the buyers and bidders that remain will be less likely to pay the prices that sellers are asking. Housing asking prices remain high in what is a very different market than just 2 years ago which will cause supply to increase.

2. Despite the fact that rates were recently cut I think potential buyers who were unable to buy during the pandemic and are now reentering the market will do so more cautiously anticipating continued rate cuts. Instead of jumping in and buying as the market expects, and possibly refinancing constantly on the way down, I think that those historic lows will cause a lot of buyers to wait for more cuts or price drops before committing. This potential dampened demand will cause a negative feedback loop with buyers continuing to wait to see if conditions worsen.

3. While inventory has remained low which is often cited for continued upward price pressure i think that we may soon see a supply spike. This part is anecdotal but I have heard from some potential sellers of both single family homes and condos who held off on listing their property during the first half of the year in anticipation of rate cuts. Some of these sellers are investors who could find themselves overextended in a cooling economy who were holding out for this point were rates are cut. Now that it has arrived they may soon start listing but due to the previous 2 reasons may not find the buyers they were expecting.

4. Return to office mandates will also be a factor especially in the previous hot markets outside of major cities. So some of the places that saw wfh people flood into town looking for yard space or extra rooms for home offices will now need to move back in closer proximity to cities which could further increase supply in certain regions. 

Either way that's all I have today. I know ever millennial still living with their granny have hoped for this to happen at some point which is exactly why it didn't but maybe this time is different. The housing market is about to correct. 
Happy hunting!"

Rivian Buying Opportunity?,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fvzda5/rivian_buying_opportunity/,63,1728049118.0,"Plenty of bad news on the company right now - lower deliveries, supply chain constraints‚Ä¶

The lower Rivian goes, it trades even closer to Cash alone. 

Even with its burn rate, it should have $7B + $4B incoming from VW, while being close to $10B now.

It sucks losing money right now, but it‚Äôs still supply chain constraints with a tougher economy - they only recently lowered rates, and as they lower it further economic tensions should ease. 

Once VW fully closes, Supply Chain eases, and economy continues to smooth, good news will better propel them higher. 

Election, economic, international, we have multiple levels of uncertainty and fear right now.

People like the product, and more on the road increases brand desire which will propel sales forward. It‚Äôs also a better product - while the R1 is expensive to produce, the R2 will be cheaper with stronger demand, followed by R3.

The R2 already has strong demand before it is released, and the R3 has even more excitement at the lower price point it will be. ~$8 was an opportunity this April, and ~$10 post VW deal is still a phenomenal time to buy this now.

Quarter to quarter waiting for good news is a hard place to be, but zoom out, think long term over next year or 2, and this is a great and painful time to buy."
"China ETFs are going to the moon in 1 week, 100%.",0,https://i.redd.it/61g2j9xbczsd1.jpeg,110,1728152394.0,"I‚Äôm a bilingual US citizen and have deep family roots in China (both politic and finance), and I know a few things about Chinese people‚Äôs trading behaviors/psychology, and Chinese government internal policies that you guys don‚Äôt know.

China is gambling their next 8-10 years of development on this bull run (though we expect US to interfere and try to fk it up).

When US was increasing interest (not for bullshit dual mandate, but for liquidity drain, sucking money from world to bankrupt countries so US can cheaply acquire their key assets, this played out many times in history), China couldn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt inject any liquidity into their markets (the money would simply ‚Äúrun away‚Äù to US and buy bonds or invest in USD related things).

Now with Feds just beginning to decrease rates (because while it bankrupts other countries, it hurts US internally as well), it‚Äôs China‚Äôs only chance this decade to heat up a market and regain trust of their own people (who spend nothing, don‚Äôt push economic growth, but have 300 trillion rmb or 42 trillion USD in savings), as well as regain trust of foreign funds (based on Hong Kong stock market, it‚Äôs working), so the heated stock market‚Äôs capital can then distribute across other sectors of China for stimulation of BOTH business development and consumer spending (of those 42 trillion USD in savings), resulting in a kick start, and in the beginning of another 8-10 year development cycle.

(China also just fired the ONLY successfully tested intercontinental ballistic missile, that CANNOT be intercepted (too fast, all interception missiles will simply chase it forever), and capable of carrying nukes, and can accurately hit anything on EARTH in 20 minutes, a week ago, to show the world China is not to be fucked with, and your capital is safe here.) 

After China stocks are up, capital will be shifted toward real estate for stabilizing and finally soft landing (so China doesn‚Äôt become another Japan), then shift towards technology to race with US, then industrial, then consumer, etc. for a total national industrial upgrade, all for the preparation of anchoring RMB as global currency.

And something about Chinese bull markets, it‚Äôs not a stable U.S. bull, it‚Äôs fast up, fast down, but up ALOT, and down ALOT. With this bull being the only bull after ~75% of Chinese population (750m people) uses Douyin(TikTok), the social media news spread paired with this 1 week holiday time for catching up with news, preparing funds, and opening stock accounts,
will send the stock market to the fking moon in a week.

Spoke to my friend who works in China Securities (biggest security company in China), she said the sales department (account opening department) of Chinese security companies in the observable history has never worked overtime, but is now open 24/7 to open accounts, we are expecting more than 20 million new stock accounts by Tuesday of China (10/7/2024 Monday of USA), and they are all LOADED.

(Chinese ETFs on US exchange: (e.g. ASHR, KSTR, CQQQ, KWEB, MCHI, CXSE, etc. etc‚Ä¶)) these all track Chinese stock groups or indexes, they are all going to the fking moon.

Chinese people are insane when it comes to quick profit, they‚Äôre taking out loans against their homes and cars as of NOW, and 10x leveraging into the stock market. The only problem right now, is stock market in China pauses for the day after reaching 10%, 20% or 30% increase (depending on which sector) in a day, meaning, they won‚Äôt even have the chance to enter the market, if that 10% jump up is instant.

Good luck all, it‚Äôll play out in a month. If you make money from this post, let me know, buy me a coffee to thank me."

Look at the chart, Reddit is continuing to take market share very quickly and it's clear that marketers are taking notice.

Domino‚Äôs (DPZ) Calls Are About to Print ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Miss Out on the Next Moonshot -Earnings,11,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fw3vb4,26,1728060599.0,"4X DPZ 460 Calls 10/18
6X DPZ 470 Calls 10/18


Alright, degenerates. Let me break it down for you: Domino‚Äôs (DPZ) is about to make a major move, and I‚Äôm all in on calls. Here‚Äôs why:

	1.	Domino‚Äôs Is the New Tech Stock: Forget software, AI, and semiconductors ‚Äì Domino‚Äôs has become the delivery platform of the future. With their investment in delivery tech (self-driving cars, drone deliveries, AI-enhanced kitchens), they‚Äôve quietly become a logistics powerhouse. They‚Äôre not selling pizza anymore, they‚Äôre selling infrastructure. Who‚Äôs going to compete? Uber Eats? LOL.
	2.	Everyone‚Äôs Broke, Everyone‚Äôs Ordering Pizza: Economic downturn? Who cares. When people get laid off, they‚Äôre not fine dining ‚Äì they‚Äôre getting Domino‚Äôs two-for-$6.99 deals. Domino‚Äôs thrives in both bull and bear markets. If the economy tanks, pizza demand soars. If the economy booms, pizza is still a staple. Heads we win, tails we win.
	3.	Short Interest and Bear Sentiment: DPZ is undervalued right now because the bears are too fixated on labor costs and inflation, but here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì the margin squeeze is temporary. Domino‚Äôs has an ace up their sleeve: they‚Äôve been raising prices sneakily through new fees, and consumers haven‚Äôt blinked. Inflation‚Äôs peaked. Watch those margins skyrocket again.
	4.	Institutions Are Sleeping on DPZ: These clowns are sleeping while Domino‚Äôs keeps expanding internationally. Delivery demand is exploding in Europe and Asia, and Domino‚Äôs is one of the few Western brands already set up to dominate. Global domination incoming, and nobody‚Äôs pricing this in.
	5.	Earnings Beat Incoming: Mark my words: Domino‚Äôs is about to crush expectations in the next earnings report. They‚Äôve been aggressively cost-cutting, plus their digital app growth is through the roof. You heard it here first ‚Äì next earnings call, DPZ prints.

Conclusion: Stop throwing your money at meme stocks with no revenue and start looking at DPZ. I‚Äôm loading up on October  calls. You‚Äôre either riding this pizza rocket with me, or you‚Äôre stuck bag-holding the rest of 2024.

TL;DR: Domino‚Äôs is the next Amazon of pizza logistics. Calls are about to print, and the bears are in for a rude awakening. Get in before the moon mission."

Why I am taking a bearish position on US energy stocks,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fwdjxu/why_i_am_taking_a_bearish_position_on_us_energy/,21,1728086428.0,"Energy [Crude Oil & Distillates] surged 9% in a week on back of geo political tensions in the Middle East.

At closing on 4th October,  Brent stood at 78.14$ & WTI at 74.45 $.

US energy companies stocks are buoyed too as a result.

But beyond the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, there is no other bullish story in the energy domain for the moment.

#1 EIA weekly petroleum report for the week of 27th September indicated build of commerical crude oil inventories [after decline for 5 consecutive week], marking an end of driving season in the US. National retail price of regular gasolein and diesel fell on weekly basis and are lower compared to a year before.
*Transport consumes 60% of crude oil in form of refined products like gasoil and gasoline.

#2 China gave significant stimulus to the economy by cutting lending rates and providing incentives to home buyers etc. Hang Seng index jumped some 25% in a week. But impact of policy changes [while reflected immediately in financial products & sectors] takes sometime to impact manufacturing, services and retail activities. China has been lagging behind in energy imports and consumption in 2024: massive sales of EV vehicles and switch to LNG for truckers are cited as major reasons, besides sluggish economy.

#3 Germany's Q2 GDP report [released on 27th August] indicated -0.1% growth rate. Another quarter of such anemic growth and Germany will be under technical recession.

#4 OPEC+ spare capacity: OPEC+ has imposed production cuts [5.7 million barrels per day] and given up market share to defend international crude oil prices. This strategy has largely not worked. 
OPEC+ will start roll back of production cut from December 2024 @ 180,000 barrels per day every month and eventually raise output by 2.16 million barrels per day in 20 months.
In August, Saudi Arabia pumped 8.9 million barrels per day out of maximum output capacity of 12 million barrels per day. But being a low cost producer [Saudi production cost is estimated at 25$ per barrel vs 65$ for US shale producers & 70$ for UK's off shore North Sea producers], it may chose to ramp up production to make the money [in volume if not in margins] to balance it budgets.

#5 Non OPEC producers: Non Opec producers like USA, Canada, Brazil, and Guyana are increasing production and thus making OPEC+ production cut strategy ineffective. 

SOME ENERGY RELATED FACTS:

US is the largest producer [13 million barrels per day] and consumer [18 million barrels per day] of crude oil 

China is the second largest consumer [16 million barrels per day] and largest importer [12 million barrels per day] of crude oil

India consumes 5 million barrels per day

Germany consumes 2 million barrels per day

OPEC+ produces almost 35% of global crude oil production 

ISRAEL-IRAN

Tel Aviv-Tehran have exchanged blows [directly and indirectly] more than once in 2024. But it is not unreasonable to assume that a full-fledged war is not on the card.

Israel yesterday has threatened an attack on Iranian oil & gas infrastructure [Iran crude oil export stands at 3 million barrels per day]. 

Indeed, an attack on Iranian oil & gas infrastructure would roil energy markets. 

But in terms of geopolitical calculus, Israel has little benefit in taking such an action:

A) It is dismantling terror infrastructure of Hezbollah and Hamaz rather successfully

B) High energy prices are detrimental to the US economy [Israel's main security partner]

C) This provocative action may cost the goodwill of non NATO countries like Japan, India, South Africa etc.

D) It would consitute an escalation and may force Iran to take even more drastic action that may compromise safety of Israeli civilians and military forces

LIKELY FUTURE COURSE

Israel will not attack Iranian nuclear, and oil & gas infrastructure. 

Energy markets are likely to stay elevated till Israel retaliates [may be as early as this weekend] 

But once some semblence of calm in Middle East is established, energy price will begin a gentle slide down [along with the price of energy stocks]

Most random public and private organizations use Service Now (NOW) to manage random internal processes. Their market cap is 189.04 billion.

We can all agree that Palantir (PLTR) will make its way into the same organizations Service Now managed to get in. Palantir's current market cap is 89.58 billion.

Let's assume that Palantir will reach the same market cap as Service Now. Service Now's market cap 189 billion, divided by Palantir's current market cap of 0.678 billion = 2.11 coefficient.

Multiply PLTR's current stock price of $40 by 2.11 which brings us to the eventual price tag of **$84.40** per share.

Is Palantir the Next Big Tech Stock or Overvalued Hype?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fx161o/is_palantir_the_next_big_tech_stock_or_overvalued/,36,1728164673.0,"# Overview

Palantir Technologies Inc. has shown strong performance recently, driven by significant growth in its U.S. commercial and government sectors. The company has been recognized for its ability to deliver enterprise AI solutions at scale, which has been a key differentiator in the market. Recent strategic partnerships and expansions, such as those with Tampa General and Panasonic Energy, highlight its focus on leveraging AI to enhance operational efficiencies. Additionally, Palantir's inclusion in the S&P 500 index and its strategic moves in AI and defense sectors have positively impacted its market perception.

# Fundamental Analysis

* **Revenue and Profitability**: Palantir reported a 27% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 2024, with total revenue reaching $678 million. The U.S. commercial sector saw a 55% increase, while the government sector grew by 23%. The company achieved a GAAP net income of $134 million, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of profitability. This growth is attributed to strong demand for AI-driven solutions and strategic commercial contracts, although revenue from these contracts is expected to decline. ‚úÖ
* **Strategic Positioning**: Palantir is heavily investing in AI and enterprise solutions, with a focus on transitioning from prototype to production. Its strategic partnerships and product innovations, such as the AIP and Warp Speed initiatives, align with its goal to dominate the AI and defense sectors. These efforts are expected to drive long-term growth and strengthen its competitive position. ‚úÖ
* **Risks**: Key risks include competitive pressures in the AI sector, potential regulatory challenges, and geopolitical tensions, particularly in regions like the Middle East. These factors could impact Palantir's ability to maintain its growth trajectory and profitability. 

# Technical Analysis

* **Price Movements**: Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility, with a recent surge to a 52-week high of $39.29. The stock has shown strong upward momentum, reflecting positive market sentiment.
* **Key Indicators**: The RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential for a price correction. The MACD shows a bullish trend, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating strong momentum. ‚úÖ
* **Support and Resistance Levels**: Key support is around $30, with resistance at the recent high of $39.29. These levels suggest potential entry and exit points for traders.

# Investment Recommendation

* **Valuation Insights**: With a trailing P/E ratio of 230.82 and a forward P/E of 91.26, Palantir appears overvalued compared to industry peers. However, its strong growth prospects and strategic positioning in AI may justify a premium valuation. ‚ö†Ô∏è
* **Short-term Outlook**: Given the current momentum and market conditions, Palantir is expected to continue its upward trend in the short term. Short-term investors might consider a buy, but should be cautious of potential volatility. ‚úÖ
* **Long-term Outlook**: Palantir's investments in AI and strategic partnerships position it well for long-term growth. However, investors should be mindful of the risks associated with geopolitical tensions and market competition. Overall, it is a¬†**hold**¬†for long-term investors. ‚úÖ
* **Final Recommendation**: Considering both the fundamental and technical analysis, Palantir is a¬†**hold**. While it has strong growth potential, the current valuation and market risks suggest caution. ‚ö†Ô∏è"

With a new CEO at the helm, Cassava seems to be trying to shift the narrative, but the underlying issues are still far from resolved. This ‚Äúmilestone‚Äù announcement looks more like an attempt to distract from the ongoing legal and ethical challenges surrounding the company.

For those holding positions or considering a move into $SAVA, it may be time to reconsider. The risks tied to the ongoing investigations and the company‚Äôs troubled history cannot be ignored. Proceed with caution‚Äîor consider shorting."
How do people cope with gains?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fwpcrf/how_do_people_cope_with_gains/,92,1728131608.0,"This sounds like a joke.  And I‚Äôm sure some people might view me as an ungrateful bastard for even making this post but as someone who made hundreds of thousands on one amazing bet by my early 30s, what do I do to make sure I‚Äôm still advancing my life and don‚Äôt lose it all?

I quit my job a few months after selling (due to fundamental issues I had with the company I was working for, not because of the gains) and have been kind of just chilling for 3 months trying to decide on my next step.  

I post this here because it‚Äôs easy to YOLO everything when you‚Äôre young and don‚Äôt have much to lose monetarily.  And it‚Äôs easy to play it safe when you‚Äôre worth $5M+.  

But what about the people with $200-500K in their early 30s, who can‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúplay it safe‚Äù if they want to be wealthy in the next 10 years, but also can‚Äôt just go around yoloing their gains into the hottest new alt coin without substantial risk of losing it all.

Feels like the only bets are: A-invest in yourself/skills and start a business B-invest in yourself/skills and buy investment real estate C-put it all into an index fund, work a 9-5 for the next 20-30 years and retire with a few mil at 60-70 so I can afford to die in peace (which doesn‚Äôt sound appealing to me tbh) lmao.

Nuclear energy- How NuScale Power ($SMR) will power the AI race.,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fvenhq/nuclear_energy_how_nuscale_power_smr_will_power/,69,1727980232.0,"The new AI economy has forced the big players to power their new data centers through nuclear energy as they can no longer rely on the grid. The biggest deal so far was announced 10 days ago by Microsoft with the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant.

More info:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-20/microsoft-s-ai-power-needs-prompt-revival-of-three-mile-island-nuclear-plant](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-20/microsoft-s-ai-power-needs-prompt-revival-of-three-mile-island-nuclear-plant)

While Microsoft is able to strike a deal for an entire nuclear plant, most of the other big players are seeking to power their future data centers through smaller scale nuclear sources, called **Small Modular Reactors.** This is the case of Oracle, announcing on their quarterly earnings call that they would be powering their new data centers through **SMRs** (without disclosing the company they were going to select). 

More info:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/oracle-is-designing-a-data-center-that-would-be-powered-by-three-small-nuclear-reactors.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/oracle-is-designing-a-data-center-that-would-be-powered-by-three-small-nuclear-reactors.html) 

**HOWEVER, Nuscale Power  is currently the only SMR technology certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and ready for commercial implementation.**

[https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-certifies-first-us-small-modular-reactor-design](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-certifies-first-us-small-modular-reactor-design)

In 2020, before the AI boom began, NuScale Power was selected by the Department of Energy to build a six-reactor 462 megawatt project in Utah, but the project was eventually cancelled as COVID related inflation drove the costs too high and the project was finally scrapped. The deal included a $1.35B in financing from the US government.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nuscale-power-uamps-agree-terminate-nuclear-project-2023-11-08/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nuscale-power-uamps-agree-terminate-nuclear-project-2023-11-08/)

**NuScale Power has  been used by the US government as a tool of geopolitical influence to ink energy infrastructure projects abroad.** 

[https://www.state.gov/u-s-and-ghana-nuclear-firms-sign-landmark-commercial-agreement-for-small-modular-reactor-project-in-ghana/](https://www.state.gov/u-s-and-ghana-nuclear-firms-sign-landmark-commercial-agreement-for-small-modular-reactor-project-in-ghana/)

Ukraine is also seeking to build SMRs through NuScale Power (link from  the official Ukraine gov).

[https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/zustrich-hermana-halushchenka-ta-kerivnytstva-kompanii-nuscale-power-realizatsiiu-pershoho-proektu-mmr-v-ukraini-bude-pryskoreno](https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/zustrich-hermana-halushchenka-ta-kerivnytstva-kompanii-nuscale-power-realizatsiiu-pershoho-proektu-mmr-v-ukraini-bude-pryskoreno)

  
Despite all of this, a bunch of illuminated retardados have decided to short the stock and the current interest sits at 25% of the float (about 25M shares). 

Being backed by the government, being the only US based company approved to build SMRs and having the interest of big US companies (like Oracle) to power their new data centers through SMRs I believe NuScale Power is prime to be one of the biggest winners AI energy race.

If you haven‚Äôt already heard Capricor therapeutics $CAPR has exploded this past 2 weeks from $4 to $21 today but this is just the beginning and it‚Äôs still very early to get in let me explain.

The company has a ground breaking drug to treat boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and has recently submitted a PR with their intention to submit a BLA application.

The drug has no reported negative side effects and also the company has a PRV voucher that can speed up the review process by the FDA or they can sell that voucher to another company for 100-150million.

Additionally as of the last finra report there are currently 7.5 million shares short or about 27% of the company‚Äôs outstanding shares.

The company has other products in their pipeline but with the approval of this drug there will be sales and revenue on top of 1.5 billion in milestones given to them by their partner Nippon Shipenyaku. 

There‚Äôs alot more DD out there but with FDA support to file BLA this is a buy and hold for 1-2 years and I think this will go way past its current $20 price. Give it a look.

**Growth:** 70% YTD, 200% over 5 years, 467% over 10 years. 4 billion in revenue in 2022, almost doubled it in 2023 with 7.8 billion, potentially another 15-20% growth in revenue in fiscal 2024. They have been steadily increasing both their revenue and profitability over the years.

**Financial health:** Relatively cheap with a PE of 23. Net debt of -54B. Dividend of 0.7% with payout ratio of 8-9%. SCHW in contrast is 1.6% with 41% payout, meaning IBKR has plenty of room for future dividend increases if they wish to( note: the dividend is a metric, not a goal in itself). Just to put this into perspective: 

* Interactive, with a market cap of 61B, handles 136B worth of assets with 70B cash-on-hand. 
* Schwab, almost double the market cap in 116B, handles 450B worth of assets with 40B cash-on-hand. 
* Robinhood, with a market cap of 20B, handles 41B worth of assets with 6.7B cash-on-hand.

Interactive has triple the market cap of Robinhood, 4 times the assets and 10 times the cash.

**Competition:** SCHW is aimed towards more investment-oriented and older demographics and Robinhood are kinda scummy with options and also known for fucking over retail. Vanguard/fidelity/JPM/MS/etc. are either private companies/operating as part of a larger company.

> excepts from center of the editorial

> China‚Äôs $18 trillion economy has been struggling across a range of sectors. Manufacturing activity, as of September, has been in contraction since April 2023, bar three months. Exacerbating the outlook are US efforts to cut China off from supplies of advanced semiconductors and other technologies set to drive future economic growth ‚Äî an approach that officials in Washington call ‚Äústrategic competition‚Äù and China decries as ‚Äúcontainment.‚Äù Confidence at home became so fragile that China‚Äôs bank loans to the real economy shrank this summer for the first time in 19 years. The balance sheets of cash-strapped local governments, which are already laden with hidden debt, are among the casualties of slumping property prices. Their revenue from land sales has been declining at a record clip, making it harder to reverse a drop in budget expenditure just when economy is in dire need of fiscal support.

> Optimism was high as China exited pandemic curbs in late 2022 and reopened its borders that the nation would see a rapid recovery in consumer spending fueled by ‚Äúrevenge shopping,‚Äù eating out and travel. That boost failed to materialize as people fretted about what weak growth means for unemployment and incomes. The years-long real estate crisis also wiped out an estimated $18 trillion in wealth from households, prompting people to save rather than spend and pushing China into its longest streak of deflation since 1999. Chinese consumption edged up slightly during a major holiday in September, adding to signs the rebound in spending by households still had a way to go. 

> Unemployment remains a concern, made worse by a regulatory crackdown on big technology companies that deprived many young, ambitious graduates of a lucrative career path. The youth jobless rate rose in August for the second straight month to its highest level this year.

> Real estate has been the main engine of China‚Äôs economic growth since President Xi Jinping came to office a decade ago. The government attempted to crack down on heavily indebted developers in 2020 to reduce risks to the financial system. That pushed house prices down and many weaker companies defaulted. Many developers stopped building homes they had already sold but hadn‚Äôt yet delivered, prompting some people to stop paying their mortgages. This turbulence was a wakeup call for many Chinese, who have long considered property a sure-bet investment and used it as a store of wealth. The pain continued into 2024, extending a trend of declines in place since early 2022. In May, China unveiled its most far-reaching attempt to revive the property market. But progress has been slow on plans that include a program to provide 300 billion yuan ($43 billion) of central bank funding to help government-backed firms buy unsold homes from developers. And given the unattractive economics of the plan for local authorities, only a fraction of more than 200 cities urged to participate by the central government are heeding the call to help absorb an excess of housing.

(SPRY) has epinephrine for allergic reactions in a nasal spray applicator. It should appeal to people who currently carry Epipens but who also hate needles. The devices became available by prescription in September.

People can follow a link on neffy.com for a virtual visit with a doctor. Alternatively they can ask their doctor to order it. Being a new device it may not be covered by insurance. Medicare does not cover it. People with commercial insurance can use a discount card to get two injectors for $25. Otherwise the cost is $199. Generic epipens are $113 with a GoodRx coupon which is 67% off the average retail price of $346.

Neffy has a shelf life of 30 months versus 18 months for Epipen.

Renaissance Lakewood, LLC, has a partnership with ARS and will be doing the actual production. Renaissance has also completed a campus expansion, adding two new packaging lines to meet the projected demand for neffy¬Æ, while ensuring the capacity to manufacture other nasal sprays. ARS‚Äôs President and CEO, Richard Lowenthal, expressed confidence in Renaissance‚Äôs ability to meet global market demands: ‚ÄúWe appreciate Renaissance‚Äôs support and diligence in helping us make neffy available across the U.S.‚Äù

There will be push back from the medical community which prefers injections versus nasal sprays for speed of delivery. And I don‚Äôt expect to see this used much in the hospital setting. It is perhaps better suited for home use for people with relatively mild allergies. Someone who has severe anaphylactic reactions will probably continue with Epipen. 

I have no expertise in investing. Mainly, given a choice I would rather spray something up my nose than jab a needle in my leg.
I do have 800 shares that I will hodl until the cows come home. Don‚Äôt know where the cows went. They were chewing the wacky weed by the fence row and my car is missing. I also have calls for Nov 15 and Jan 17.

This is not investing advice. Please do your own DD.
