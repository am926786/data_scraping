I believe this is 1-2 years away.\\n\\nImagine you can live in a robovan for $8 a day (or $1 per hour)...basically IN THE CENTER of New York. That's $2800 per year, or $140,000 in a lifetime.

They have been operating a fleet of robo taxis (fully autonomous cars) in multiple cities for a while now. \\n\\nSo I did a short comparison and analysis. \\n\\n\\n\\nKEY POINTS FROM \"WE, ROBOT\" EVENT:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production.\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n2. Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab production by 2026 — although he said it could be as late as 2027. \\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n3. Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000-$30,000, and is capable of performing various tasks.\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n4. Cybercab was revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla\\'s \"We, Robot” event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of non-public roads for the demonstration. \\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n5. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn\\'t rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n\\n\\nTESLA VS WAYMO : KEY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACH \\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n1. Sensing the World:\\n\\n -  - Waymo\\'s Multi-Sensor Fusion:  Waymo uses a suite of sensors that work together. This is like having multiple senses.\\n\\n\\nI. Lidar:  Acts like super-precise radar, creating a 3D \"point cloud\" of the surroundings. This excels in low-light and complex environments.\\n\\nII. Radar: Detects objects and their speed, even in rain or fog.\\n   \\n\\nIII. Cameras: Provide visual information for recognizing objects like traffic lights and pedestrians.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- - Tesla\\'s Vision-Only System: Tesla relies heavily on cameras, believing that they can provide enough data for AI to understand the world like humans do.\\n\\n\\nI. Neural Networks:  Tesla uses powerful AI to process the visual data from cameras.\\n\\n\\nII. No Lidar:  Tesla famously excludes lidar, arguing it\\'s expensive and unnecessary.\\n\\n\\n- Why this matters:  Lidar provides highly accurate depth and distance data, which is crucial for navigating complex situations. Tesla\\'s vision-only approach is more ambitious but may struggle in conditions where cameras are less effective (e.g., heavy rain, fog).\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n\\n2. Understanding the Environment:\\n\\nI. Waymo\\'s HD Maps: Waymo creates incredibly detailed 3D maps of the areas where its vehicles operate. These maps include road geometry, lane markings, traffic signs, and even the positions of trees and buildings.\\n\\n\\nII.  Localization: This allows Waymo\\'s cars to precisely locate themselves within the map, even in challenging conditions.\\n\\n\\nIII. Predictability:  Maps help anticipate what\\'s coming and plan routes accordingly.\\n\\n\\nIV.  Tesla\\'s Real-Time Learning: Tesla relies less on pre-mapped environments. Its AI learns to interpret the world in real-time, based on the data it gathers from its cameras.\\n\\n\\nV. Generalization: The goal is to create a system that can drive anywhere, not just in pre-mapped areas.\\n\\n\\nVI. Adaptability: Tesla\\'s system can potentially adapt to new environments and situations more quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n- - Why this matters: Waymo\\'s HD maps provide a high level of certainty in known areas, but mapping is expensive and time-consuming. Tesla\\'s approach is more scalable but relies heavily on the AI\\'s ability to correctly interpret complex scenes.\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n\\n3. Deployment Strategies:\\n\\nI. Waymo\\'s Gradual Rollout: Waymo has focused on deploying its robotaxi service in specific cities, starting with Phoenix. This allows for careful testing and refinement in controlled environments.\\n\\n\\nII.  Safety First:  Waymo prioritizes safety and has a strong track record.\\n\\nIII.  Controlled Expansion:  They expand their service area gradually as they gain confidence in their technology.\\n\\n\\n\\n IV.  Tesla\\'s Beta Testing: Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to a wider group of drivers. This allows them to gather vast amounts of real-world driving data.\\n\\n\\nV.  Rapid Iteration:  Tesla can quickly improve its system through frequent software updates.\\n\\n\\n VI. Driver Responsibility:  FSD is still a driver-assist system, and drivers are expected to remain vigilant and take over when necessary.\\n\\n\\n- -  Why this matters: Waymo\\'s approach is more cautious, prioritizing safety and controlled testing. Tesla\\'s approach is faster and more agile, but it also carries more risk, as evidenced by accidents involving FSD.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese are some of the core differences between Waymo and Tesla\\'s approach to self-driving. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of technology, but their philosophies and strategies are quite distinct. It will be fascinating to see how these approaches evolve in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n. . . . . .  . \\n\\n\\nEDIT:  THE MUSK PARADOX \\n\\n\\nThe entire Tesla brand is highly dependent on Elon. Essentially Elon is Tesla. A lot of the Tesla Brand value is tied up with Elon Musk the human.\\n\\nThis wasn\\'t a problem in the past when Elon seemed like a nerd who just loved tech and posted memes.\\n\\nFast forward to 2024, the guy is full blow republican (not saying it\\'s bad or good). He is actively involved with politics.\\n\\nIMO, He\\'s too busy \"owning the libs\" and fighting cultural wars (\"woke virus\"). \\n\\nNow combine this with his other behavioral problems like self administration of ketamine and using other drugs, and we have a recipe for disaster.\\n\\n\\nFYI, I\\'m not an Elon Hater. I used to admire him and it\\'s sad to watch his downfall.\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\nTLDR;\\n\\n\\nIMO, the event was Very Disappointing. \\n\\nElon announced (NOT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED) basically what he has been promising for years (TRUE AUTONOMY AKA FSD).\\n\\nIt was no different than the previous announcements of FSD and Cybertruk.\\n\\nI expect delays (regulatory approvals and the actual tech being ready).\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n\\n. . . . . \\n\\n\\nUPDATE :\\n\\n. . . . . \\n\\nFor all the regards who don\\'t understand what WAYMO actually is, I just did another post analyzing Google (the owner of Waymo) and why they\\'re the number 1 player in AI, robotics and self driving.\\n\\n. . .\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/d3tSIKLRIJ'}\n",

This company was [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) and has rebranded itself.\\xa0Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before.\\n\\nAlright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in.\\n\\nAbout the Company:\\n\\n[Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore.\\n\\nIn 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.)\\n\\nBut somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining.\\n\\nEnter Marcus Lemonis:\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yi3ayo0yw4ud1.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a79453f4375c3d023bbe6b615fea95091281919\\n\\nHe currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com), and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) website.\\n\\nSo this is what happened:\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k29wwhq1x4ud1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f07b394c5fae9a6100f0485d99947b5ca5fa0f\\n\\nNow the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together.\\n\\nIf you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me:\\n\\n“Mr. Jimbles, you’re *highly* regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.”\\n\\nAnd to which I will respond:\\n\\n“Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.”\\n\\nBut this what has happened very recently:\\n\\n* In July 2024 the [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.\\xa0\\n* The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods.\\n* Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. [Zulily.com](http://zulily.com)\\n* Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have.\\n* They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally.\\n* They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves.\\n\\nBut that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way.\\n\\nAnd even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me.\\n\\nMaybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e14afd63x4ud1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a10afa53ba0956584ce72106fd4fae5a8fdb9b3\\n\\nWhat we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know.\\n\\nYou like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go:\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrf6twx4x4ud1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=3919615e3efb1dfb2c607e2ceda81efa27f7b49c\\n\\nOn the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days.\\n\\nLook at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries:\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kzlw1r5x4ud1.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=14f6bbd1ebff4210af79e2eef6995167c886a1f5\\n\\nSo what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet.\\n\\nHere’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10:\\n\\n[https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx](https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx)\\xa0\\n\\nListen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now.\\n\\nIf you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least *she* might be proud of you.\\n\\nSo what do I expect with the BYON stock?\\n\\nShort/medium term: Up.  \\nLong term: Really up.\\n\\nIt looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES.\\n\\nHere are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished.\\n\\nPositions:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikdcrnv7x4ud1.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc49f739ee9e7bf277bac88bd08ed12d3e52abcb\\n\\nShotgun approach.\\xa0Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves.\\n\\nThe random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash:\\n\\nLiquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. *wait.* You're thinking you'll just avoid all this by buying ITM/NTM? On a stock this undervalued?? Go back to where you belong. You know...that special sub where their best and only advice is DCA'ing into SPY.\\n\\nI recommend doing limits or 1 lot market orders b/c you might even get a few better fills that way. If you do big market orders you’re gonna get cucked on the way in and on the way out… if you make it that far. If you don’t know what the word slippage means...good luck. \\\\*\\\\*Hint\\\\*\\\\* It doesn't have anything to do with what happens to your wife while watching you unbutton her boyfriend's sport-coat.\\n\\nSee y'all in a bit.\\n\\n-Jimbles\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Disclaimer: All information contained in this post is factually correct to the best of my knowledge.

Markets rallied for about 3 weeks, and SPX closed at an all-time high on October 9, 2007, which would not be matched again until March 2013 in recovery from the Great Financial Crisis.\\n\\nOn September 18, 2024, the Fed made a 50bps rate cut, greater than expected, despite reasonably good economic data. Markets rallied for about 3 weeks, and SPX closed at an all-time high today, October 9, 2024.\\n\\nThis is not financial advice nearly as much as it is anecdotal evidence that we live in the Matrix.\\n\\nOther thoughts:\\n\\nThe Sahm rule stood at only 17bps as of the unemployment reading of September 2007, as opposed to 50bps in September 2024. Albeit, unemployment was generally higher right around 4.6-4.7% between late 2006-2007. Additionally, the part-time gig economy is MASSIVE today compared to 2007 (but BLS still counts that as not “unemployed”)\\n\\nThe VIX was hovering between 16-18 during the October 2007 market peak, compared to 20-22 today.\\n\\nYear-over-year CPI change from December 2006 to December 2007 was 4.1%, so inflation was NOT dead when the Fed started their easing cycle. The bond market is implying a similar problem in today’s economy with increasing US treasury yields, although current YoY CPI readings are generally lower today than in 2007.\\n\\nUnlike 2007, this is an election year, and I operate under the assumption that all current BLS statistics are not just cooked, but deep fried.\\n\\nEDIT: Going to try to address some of the repeated comments I’m seeing here.\\n\\n“PAST PERFORMANCE DOESN’T GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS”\\n\\nOf course, the main point of this post was to highlight the similarities in timelines between today and 17 years ago. Our economic situation is MASSIVELY different, although I’d argue still weak.\\n\\n“BUT THERE’S NO SUBPRIME CRISIS”\\n\\nRight, probably not. However, we still have skyrocketing consumer credit defaults paired with an abysmally low personal savings rate. Additionally, we have something along the lines of $1 trillion CRE loans with balloon payments or adjustable rates kicking in within the next 6 months, on a bunch of loans that are underwater with their respective banks, and many of which have been collateralized into CLOs and sold both domestically and internationally. I still think there will be some blood in the water.\\n\\nAdditionally, the median house price to median income ratio is HIGHER today than it was at its 2007-2008 absolute peak, so I’d still argue that real estate has been over-speculated.\\n\\n“THE GOVERNMENT WON’T LET THE MARKET CRASH DURING AN ELECTION YEAR”\\n\\nProbably not! In fact, there’s a very real scenario where the Fed steps in with hyper-QE if things hit the fan. Congress is scheduled to meet in January 2025 to negotiate the current US debt ceiling, and the US frankly can’t afford a recession right now - they need those tax dollars. Hyperinflation to erode the real value of the US debt and prop up the markets is highly plausible IMO.\\n\\n“DUMB BER”\\n\\nDumb bol.\\n\\n“POSITIONS OR BAN”\\n\\nI’m short term bullish on bonds. TLT just bounced off its 200 SMA twice and I wouldn’t be surprised to see investors eat up those nice high yields if earnings season goes sour. I have 6 figures on TLT calls expiring post-election, I’m gonna wait on SPX plays until the election is over.\\n\\n**TLDR: The Fed cut rates on the exact same date (9/18) in 2007 as 2024, and SPX hit an all-time high on the exact same date (10/9) in 2007 as 2024, except it was a massive crash afterwards in 2007.

Go watch some NHL video from 1980. Now watch some NHL video from today. Those idiots in 1980 would absolutely suck today. They\\'d be too slow and too dumb to play anywhere near the top league today. Same with other sports. \\n\\nThat\\'s human nature. Through time we improve incrementally. We use the knowledge of prior generations as a base and add to it. So it\\'s no surprise that an NBA player from 1980 would look like Krusty the Clown on a modern NBA team.\\n\\nWell guess what, same shit has happened in investing & trading. And on an even bigger scale. The stakes are much higher. Instead of your high school star athlete making the big leagues, we\\'re talking about the most powerful companies in the world making superyacht money. The amount of resources devoted to \"solving\" markets is astronomical.\\n\\nSo now we have a different landscape from your dad\\'s stupid tech company in 1998. Yeah, they were cute firing up their shitty computers and randomly pressing some buttons in a suit & tie. Investors were onto something back in the 90\\'s tech bubble though. They realized the trick to investing...\\n\\nFRONT RUN EVERYTHING\\n\\nYeah bitch. Front run fucking everything. Radio on the internet? Fuck it, here\\'s a billion dollars. Pets.com? Sure, you get $500M. Yeah, they took it a little too far in the 90\\'s. But guess what, they were right. The internet was the future and the right early bets on internet companies made you wildly rich.\\n\\nThe reality was that, you could be wrong on 20 picks so long as you had the 1 Amazon / Microsoft / Apple. Plus, since people weren\\'t front running as much back then, you didn\\'t need to drop 100X Price-Sales on most of these picks (pre-1999). So who the fuck cares if you bought [Pets.com](http://Pets.com), [Broadcast.com](http://Broadcast.com), your dad\\'s shitty tech startup? So long as you just accidentally bought one of the fucking juggernauts, all mistakes were easily forgiven.\\n\\nSo yeah, today we are thinking \"DAMN, Everything is so Expensive!\" \"AI is a Bubble!\" But guess what, that\\'s just Boomer talk. From now on, everything that has a remote chance at being successful is gonna be front run to shit. You can forget about getting in at the bottom floor. Once an industry even hints that it will make a splash, some bastards are going to buy the shit out of it. The days where your dumb ass is gonna find Tesla at $10 or NVDA at $50 are long gone buddy.\\n\\nSo thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. Stop crying about valuations. The market is just smarter than it used to be. No one\\'s saying THE PRICE IS RIGHT. They just don\\'t give a fuck. Because a single 100X excuses 99 dingleberries.'}\n",

It owns 14 million shares as of June 30 (, with a likely cost of $3.22 per share, representing 3.775% of the company’s shares outstanding (CSO). While GTCR has a history of fully buying out closely-held companies, that is unlikely to be the case here. If its purpose is to influence the board, a significant ownership stake is generally around 5% to 10% or more, which can provide leverage in discussions with the company. GTCR would need to acquire at least another 5-6 million shares to surpass the 5% threshold, which would require the firm to file a Schedule 13D, indicating control intent. My speculation is that GTCR will continue to buy shares throughout this quarter and beyond to gain leverage with the board, especially as the company searches for a permanent CEO. The timing seems well-suited for both Peloton’s corporate restructuring and GTCR’s long-term strategy to influence control of the company. We will know more next quarter from its 13F disclosure. \\n\\nGet on the rocket ships '}\n",

You can see deets on those in my post history.\\n\\nFirst, here\\'s what my model predicts:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mw8a6y2ozxtd1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=50eef67e1fb2c60b19ab43fe56b7bad8c96ce6a2\\n\\nIt says a fair value right now for the contracts is about $7.5; I got mine for $7. A Monte Carlo simulation based on the underlying stock\\'s historical behavior in the 30 days leading up to earnings and ATM contract IV run-up suggests the option should, on average, rise in value over the next 30 days. The upper red line is the 90% percentile, the blue line is the mean, and the lower lines are the 10% and 1%, respectively.\\n\\nBased on fundamentals, I think we\\'ll see the stock rise over the next 30 days, because:\\n\\n* INGR always beats EPS estimates, so as forecasts start getting dialed in over the next few weeks, buying should pick up.\\n* The company has an internal initiative called \"Cost2Compete\", started last year, where they\\'re driving down costs. As they predicted, this year sale revenue is down, but because of Cost2Compete their costs are down *lower* and so profit is up YoY.\\n* They are targeting $50M in cost savings by end of 2025, and are at $18M currently. They didn\\'t revise that $50M number, so I expect to see higher savings this quarter than last, meaning even *higher* profitability.\\n* They withstood inflation and high rates just fine, and their forex impacts were a wash so far this year, so as inflation drops, sales should pick up. Combined with reduced costs, they should show excellent earnings, and I think the market will foresee that.\\n* Their guidance for this coming quarter is still conservative, and was made pre-rate cuts and inflation reports, so sales might *already* be up.\\n\\nI\\'ll be looking to close this one around 25-30%, depending on how IV goes over the next week or two.'}\n",

A bunch of nerds enriching uranium, specifically “LEU” (yes it’s the ticker for the company AND the main product they produce): Low Enriched Uranium. Why does this matter? Well, the vast majority of \"traditional\" reactors that exist within the United States today leverage LEU for fuel. And oh by the way, those reactors that were so dangerous and scary in the past (due to the general public being fucking stupid) are now coming back online because, shocker, we have no other choice and nuclear energy is actually INCREDIBLY safe, reliable and efficient.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31hl2oy0hltd1.jpg?width=804&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bf2a8c2922bbd39164dbe05f840e7c2c26722eb\\n\\nSo how does Centrus benefit from all of this?

HALEU stands for High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium.

Because all of the \\\\*next-gen\\\\* reactors (OKLO, SMR, etc…) are going to require HALEU to function. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/artfqop5hltd1.jpg?width=915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9d5b9563badf6b25fd322426da46011a4f6fbad\\n\\nThe demand for HALEU is going to skyrocket and while there are global players, Centrus is the only domestic USA supplier of HALEU right now.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szm92ko6hltd1.jpg?width=603&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d5bc735185266af7155421772bd865ea57d42b8\\n\\nAnd with some other names out there (I won’t call them out as they’re below 500m mc) that are relying on hype and pitch decks for ridiculous nuclear technologies that aren’t feasible (at least in the next few decades), Centrus is actually delivering on their commitments.

And, once again, Centrus is the \\\\*sole\\\\* public company that competes in the market of LEU and HALEU supply. What is kind of hilarious is the fact that on the DOE RFP page, they literally call out the near-monopoly Centrus has in this space in theri Q&A section:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s0hhxs29hltd1.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cc0ae087e677fab079ab43277621b04968bf56f\\n\\nAs of this last Friday, October 4th, the DOE awarded $800m in TCV (total contract value) to 4 RFP respondents, which includes Centrus (their subsidiary American Centrifuge Operating LLC), $BWXT and 2 private companies. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49g6zuo7iltd1.jpg?width=678&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fe66d604d54b2a1d50dc367cb4d7f9a68e762a5\\n\\nBWXT is another nuclear aligned name that has great upside, and it’s worth noting that they actually have an equity interest in Centrus.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0uc7yx9hltd1.jpg?width=584&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2aa36583931e7685a759d5e417e0f96e0d4576e\\n\\nThe contract ceiling for the “HALEU Deconversion” award is $2.7b\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prh26glahltd1.jpg?width=1212&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4de46494e752b41b42715afa669a443f32a577a0\\n\\nAdditionally, via Centrus 8-k filings, they note that this is just one RFP and there are others (at least one) that are still pending:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8616mvfbhltd1.jpg?width=1681&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3599b8a428687e0e55e1e26a0a0aadc33ff9bf2b\\n\\n“But wait a second, Centrus in the $30 range a month ago and now it’s $65 (at closing on October 8th), it’s done!

The short exposure to this stock has also been increasing, which is an added layer of dimensionality to the name.\\n\\nSo what could nuke (heh) this trade? A few things. Bad industry PR is \\\\*always\\\\* a risk when it comes to nuclear power/energy. Next could be dilution. They aren’t strapped for cash, but they’ve used their current ATM over the past year. Despite that, they are not serial dilutors (which you can verify yourself):\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vpzkn7vdhltd1.jpg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c263675266a2c03d3e7f4cd2398154ec79c09399\\n\\nAnother risk one might consider is political. As we have a presidential election coming up, the incoming president’s policy may have a huge impact on investments. However, it’s worth noting that public sentiment for nuclear energy is near ATHs and both candidates have expressed positive opinions on domestic nuclear energy. Trump more explicit vs. Harris being a bit more guarded on her energy policy.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Trump policy example](https://preview.redd.it/9v1iw86fhltd1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=845702d8a68d30b0f55474c06803916b0d7a5cf2)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Harris policy example](https://preview.redd.it/ji0gauvfhltd1.jpg?width=838&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f85d1a886ccb344cf4ecfd9c4a7bf91c60cf297)\\n\\n**Tl;dr**\\n\\n**Centrus Energy represents a unique and differentiated opportunity within the nuclear basket, one that involves a company that is \\\\*actually making money\\\\* and has a well protected and actively demonstrated moat.** \\n\\nLong shares and Nov/Jan calls. Worth noting that after this run up, premiums are definitely juiced. Chasing OTM calls here is a sure way to get rekt at least until IV cools down a bit. I’ve also thrown money at $BWXT and $CW for broader nuclear plays as I genuinely believe nuclear power is only going to become more and more important within the United States and the rest of the world.'}\n",

As a result, they flock to value investments because they realize that companies like Bank of America are resilient, undervalued and going to grow in a high-interest environment which we could be looking at in December.\\xa0\\n\\nThe same thing happens in a bubble, and it is no secret that AI is a bubble as of now considering the ludicrous difference in implicit and intrinsic valuations.\\xa0\\n\\nLooking at NVDA, it is easy to see how we could be looking at the first half of a repeat of the 3D Printing bubble in 2014. \\xa0\\n\\nThat is not to say that, 3D printing is akin to AI, however, it is almost guaranteed that NVDA fill be facing a significant correction (like AAPL did in December 2022 and December 2023) after a rally due to the incoming CPI data (unlike AAPL).\\xa0\\n\\nWe are too late to invest in growth stocks and too early to buy value stocks, so we are faced with a dilemma:\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can we invest on the tipping point of the economy’s growth?\\xa0\\n\\nTo be honest, I have no fucking clue, however, with CPI data coming 8:00 E.T, that could change: if CPI is significantly higher than before, a world of high interest rate December will become much more visible, if it is significantly lower, then we will see a big rally for companies like NVDA. Anything in between a clear-cut CPI , will just muddy the waters as the stock market is rife with AI speculative delusion.\\xa0\\n\\nWhat is certain, however, is that NVDA, sooner or later, will get a really painful reality check, and if you don’t believe me, you shouldn't, because I don't know what I'm yapping about.\\n\\nWhat is going to happen?

Another couple of months and we should have the answer to this multi-year mystery of Alzheimer’s.  This is the last chance to invest in this promising drug before the potential rise despite the mainstream allegations against this company. Strap yourselves in, this is a long one. Jump to conclusion and tldr if you’re impatient.\\n\\n**Allegations**\\n\\nOn June 28, the DoJ announced charges made against Dr. Wang  for scientific misconduct and fraud that gained him NIH funding. Here’s why I believe Dr. Wang will be found innocent. Back in 2021 a citizens petition was filed by “whistleblowers” to the FDA led by Dr. Bredt, a neurologist who had history with Dr. Wang back when Wang did work for Johnson & Johnson. Turns out they were not whistleblowers at all and were actually short sellers, and in the case of Dr. Bredt, a competitor.  Dr. Bredt, with support from Johnson & Johnson, founded RAPP Therapeutics that is developing small molecule drugs that follow the same mechanism as Cassava’s drug simufilam.  Ironic right? And he filed an IPO the same day the FDA rejected the citizens petition. What a coincidence right? Thru this citizens petition, Journal of Neuroscience posted an expression of concern for scientific misconduct and fabrication of Dr. Wang’s research data. Following this expression of concern, Dr. Wang submitted all the original data and blots to JoN in which they concluded there was no evidence of manipulation.  However, thanks to some motivated PhDs on Twitter, who lack any impactful research papers of their own, continued harassing the editors in which JoN issues an expression of concern and will defer to CUNY (that is a whole another fiasco with massive conflict of interests).  Recently the SEC announced settlements made with Casaava, its ex-senior executives, and Dr. Wang.  In Dr. Wang’s settlement, the SEC provides data which Dr. Wang could have unblinded himself in a reanalysis of a small 28 day study measuring biomarker changes in patients who received simufilam vs placebo. Now the only problem with their allegation that they settled for, the data they provided MATCHES a concurrent plasma biomarker analysis from a third party, independent and industry known company, Quanterix. I should just stop my post here but I will continue. After 3 years of senseless investigations by the DoJ and SEC, this is the best they can come up with. Hey this minor 28 day study of biomakers reanalysis could have been made up EVEN though quanterix data matches it. On top of all this, the biomakers in question were of a 28 day study. When they began their phase 2 cog study, they performed csf biomarker analysis after 6 months which showed 98% had a positive effect. There was never any question on this more significant biomarker analysis. There was never any question of the quanterix data.  It is without a doubt if there was even a hint of manipulation there it would been used to crucify Cassava. \\n\\nWhy I think with all these allegations Cassava still has a high probability of success? Because I look at it as pieces of a puzzle.  There are many pieces involved in this mystery. Firstly and most importantly, there is the 24 month open label Adas-cog study that shows patients especially mild  have NO cognitive decline.  This has NEVER been heard of.  Additionally there are multiple independent sources of research that supports simufilam and the importance of Filamin A (the protein simufilam targets) in neuropathology including prestigious Yale. Yale even patented simufilam use for epilepsy. Included in the supporting research is the TR-Fret study that uses the most sophisticated assay (far superior than WBs) to prove simufilams MoA. Additionally there are the biomarkers from quanterix, the more important 6 month biomakers NEVER questioned, insiders suspiciously increasing positions earlier in the year, and the almost 90% of  patients choosing to continue in the open label extension of the Ph3 to stay on the drug and demanding to extend even the open label extension for early patients. I will post links to the research below.\\n\\n**The Stock**\\n\\nThe float of this stock is almost 50% shorted and many big suits are involved imo. Can you see why they are trying to destroy the company. If this drug proves itself, this stock will be worth at the very least $50 Billlion in market cap and that’s without factoring in short interest.  Why they will not be successful in bringing this company down? Because there is a strong investor base made of doctors, PhDs, pharmacists, and engineers who have done multiple years of DD and will not be shaken.  As long as the data continues to impress, people will not be selling.\\n\\n**Conclusion & Approach**\\n\\nSomeone said to me that if Dr. Wang lied about the biomakers then all of it is lie, which is absolutely true, and also can be said about the shorts.  So my approach to come to my conclusion is looking at all the independent pieces to this puzzle. The puzzle pieces all fit perfectly with Dr. Wangs preclincal research and biomarker analysis being correct. They do not fit with Dr. Wang committing fraud. To date Dr Wang has NOT been found guilty of fraud, only allegations.  Could ALL the independent institutions be lying about simufilam and Filamin A?  I think the DoJ will eventually drop the case or maybe slap on the wrist for record keeping issues.  Now let’s look at the shorts, the very first statement was a lie. They lied about being whistleblowers and they lied about being short sellers. Dr. Bredt lied about never hearing of Cassava when he had history with Dr. Wang, and he lied that he thought the science was nonsense.  Why do we know that’s a lie, because he literally started a company that is pursuing the same kind of small molecule targeting receptor associated proteins such as Filamin A.\\n\\nSo ask yourself, do you believe the shorts, the doj, the sec who we know for a fact are not retails friend? Just look at the madness in 2021. Or just maybe there is more to this story than what’s being reported by our wonderful mainstream media.  Just look at the state of this country and the influence of media. I really don’t care for anyone to invest but more to put the story out there. At this point it’s either the moon or the grave (not literally).\\n\\n**TLDR:** Phase 3 is done will answer ALL questions with no doubt left, Too much independent research on simufilam and Filamin A (too many pieces of the puzzle fit perfectly together with Wang being innocent), SEC twists data to make it look bad now out the way after settlement. Ph3 data comes out by year end and stock will rocket if our thesis is correct by over 20X. Almost 50% of the float short is just a cherry on top. In other words SAVA to $500 if data good and $1,000 or more if amazing. If fail then no doubt 0 but I am highly convinced of success.\\n\\n**New Positions:** 6,000 shares with avg cost $24(Don’t try it shorts I’ll just add more) 10 $15 call leaps. First invested in 2021\\n\\nNot financial or medical advice, do your own DD\\n\\n**Links** of additional research on simufilam and Filamin A and there is much more than this. Do note some of the papers — not all — has wang as a author, but he **did not perform the experiments**,  it’s just his research being investigated by other scientists.\\n\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10531384/\\n\\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32075941/\\n\\nhttps://eo.bioscientifica.com/configurable/content/journals$002feo$002f2$002f1$002fEO-22-0055.xml?t:ac=journals%24002feo%24002f2%24002f1%24002fEO-22-0055.xml\\n\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10339288/\\n\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33197/ **Parkinson’s potential**\\n\\n\\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39164108/ **Autism potential**\\n\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9132466/\\n\\n\\n\\n'}\n",

I know the market sentiment around Intel is absolute trash and trust me, there are valid reasons for that. But hear me out: I think people are being too negative, and that’s driving the stock price way lower than it should be, which is why I think this might be a solid gamble.\\n\\nNow, just to be clear, I’m not trying to convince anyone to follow what I’m saying here. This is just my take, and I’m throwing it out there for discussion and to give you some food for thought.\\n\\n**Intel is trading at book value, where does it go from here?**\\n\\nLet’s start with the basics: Intel is a massive company. We're talking about a company that is literally a cornerstone of U.S. tech infrastructure. This is not just some meme stock that goes up and down based on Elon’s tweets. Intel matters strategically to the U.S., which is why I think it’s important to look at it a bit differently. Right now, it’s trading at or near book value. For those who don’t know, that’s basically what the company’s assets are worth on paper. So if Intel is trading at book value, where the hell is it supposed to go?\\n\\nSure, stocks can drop below book value when a company is in deep trouble, but Intel isn’t just some random struggling company. Intel is too important for the U.S. to let it just die. We’ve seen it happen before—companies that are crucial to national interests often get government support or favorable treatment (throwing money at them) even when things go bad. So yeah, Intel’s price could dip below NAV (Net Asset Value), but it’s highly unlikely to go to zero. At this price, you’re paying for a pile of assets that aren't getting the love they deserve.\\n\\n**Bad market sentiment doesn’t always last forever**\\n\\nMarket sentiment is trash right now. Everyone’s convinced that Intel is finished because they’ve lost market share to AMD and Nvidia. Fair enough, those companies have been eating Intel’s lunch for a while. But sentiment can swing like a wrecking ball, and when the market hates something this much, that’s where opportunities often pop up. People love to bet on momentum, and when a stock starts free-falling, it's easy for everyone to scream “they’re gonna fail” without taking a step back and actually looking at the risk/reward setup.\\n\\n**What’s 18A and why it matters**\\n\\nNow, let’s get to the meat of this: 18A. Intel is basically betting the entire company on this process, and if they succeed, it’s a game-changer. 18A is their next-generation chip manufacturing process, and it’s a big deal because it could allow Intel to actually start competing again in the semiconductor space after getting dunked on by TSMC and Samsung for years.\\n\\nLet me be clear, I’m not saying 18A is a sure thing. It’s not. In fact, it could blow up in their faces, and everyone who’s short Intel will be popping champagne. But the upside here is massive if they pull it off. The downside is already baked into the stock price, in my opinion. The way I see it, Intel is trading as if 18A is already a failure, which seems too pessimistic given the progress they’ve made.\\n\\n**The Dice Roll Theory – Arbitrary, but it shows the risk/reward**\\n\\nSo here's a thought experiment: imagine the chance of Intel successfully pulling off 18A was completely random, like rolling a dice. Let’s say there’s a 1-in-6 chance of success. If they fail, the stock could drop to $10 (worst case scenario). But if they succeed, it could shoot up to $100 or more. This setup would give an expected value of $25. Obviously, these numbers are arbitrary, but they show the kind of risk/reward balance we’re looking at. The point is, the market is pricing Intel like 18A has already failed, and any chance of success would drastically increase the stock’s value.\\n\\nNow, if you assume the upside is $60 instead of $100, yeah, the bet becomes less attractive. In that case, it might not be a +EV gamble, which is why it’s important to consider your own risk tolerance. But for me, even if the upside isn't as dramatic, I still see value in the potential rebound, especially given how pessimistic the market is being right now.\\n\\n**The market is pricing in disaster, but the risk/reward equation here looks attractive, especially when you consider Intel’s importance to the U.S. government. They’re not just going to let Intel go bankrupt without trying to step in. Plus, Intel has other projects in the pipeline. They’re not just sitting on their hands hoping 18A works out. The company is actively trying to turn things around.**\\n\\n**The CEO and Intel's strategy – Misunderstood?**\\n\\nNow let’s talk about Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO. I think he’s actually making the tough but right calls here. The dude came back to Intel to fix the mess, and instead of trying to please the market in the short term, he’s gone all-in on fixing the core problems. They’ve sacrificed a lot of unnecessary projects and are basically saying, “We’re betting it all on 18A.” That takes balls, and I think the market is misunderstanding his approach.\\n\\nYeah, in the short term, this strategy makes Intel look like it’s bleeding cash, and everyone freaks out. But this is what happens when you cut the fat and focus on what matters. They’re essentially hitting the reset button, which can make things look worse before they get better.\\n\\n**What about Intel’s other businesses?**\\n\\nLet’s not forget, Intel isn’t a one-trick pony. They’ve got other businesses that are still generating cash flow. It’s not like they’re running on fumes. Even if 18A doesn’t hit as fast as we hope, Intel has enough going on to keep them afloat for a while. Plus, they’ve still got massive R&D going into new technologies. They aren’t just sitting around waiting for 18A to save them—they’re diversifying their bets.\\n\\n**The geopolitical angle – U.S. needs Intel**\\n\\nWith all the geopolitical tension going on, the U.S. isn’t going to let Intel just slip away into irrelevance. The U.S. government knows how important semiconductors are for defense, tech, and the economy. We’re seeing more and more government interest in building up domestic semiconductor capacity (CHIPS Act, anyone?), and Intel is perfectly positioned to benefit from that. More money is going to get thrown at them, either directly or indirectly, because the U.S. simply cannot afford to rely on foreign chipmakers forever.\\n\\n**Conclusion – Why I’m betting on Intel**\\n\\nTo wrap this all up, here’s why I think Intel is worth a gamble:\\n\\n* The market is too negative, and the stock is trading at book value.\\n* Intel is strategically important to the U.S., so they’re not going to be left hanging.\\n* The upside potential from 18A is huge, while the downside is likely already baked in.\\n* The CEO’s strategy is misunderstood. He’s sacrificing short-term gains for long-term survival.\\n* The U.S. government’s focus on building domestic semiconductor capacity is a tailwind for Intel.\\n\\nThis is not your typical meme stock play. It's not a hype-driven rocket to $1,000 overnight. But if you’re looking for something that’s undervalued and has a solid chance of turning things around, Intel could be the bet. I think this is a +EV gamble, and that’s why I’m taking it.\\n\\nI’m not saying it’s a sure thing, but given the risk/reward setup, this looks like a bet worth taking.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Intel is being slept on, 18A is a potential game-changer, and the U.S. isn’t going to let them fail without a fight. High risk, high reward, +EV play.\"}\n",

However, the ticker names YINN/YANG immediately caught my attention, they are the 3x bull/bear ETFs that track FTSE 50 index of Chinese stock market (we can think of it as SPY 50 instead of 500). At the time, they were up and down 20%+, I was like what just happened. When I went over to check the index, the SSE was up more than 4% in a single day! I quickly read over the news and realized that it\\'s a huge huge opportunity, and perfect timing. The Chinese stock market has been in a bear market for a couple of years, this could be the inflection point, and it was only the second day. To give readers a little context about myself, I was born and raised in China, immigrated to Canada in my teenage, and started full time trading on my own after graduation from university, so I have no problem reading Chinese news (I will not discuss the news here or take any political view, the only thing I can say is if an experienced trader sees this news and market condition, he/she will know it\\'s a big big opportunity).\\n\\nWhat is TIGR? It\\'s a brokerage firm that mainly operates in Singapore/Hong Kong and some other continents, but not mainland China due to the events that happened couple years ago, it is listed on the US exchange. The direct competitor is FUTU, which is another brokerage firm listed on the US exchange, with a larger market cap and user base. These two firms mainly serve Mandarin (or other types of Chinese variant) speakers around the world, but they of course support other languages. So why did I pick TIGR from the list of about 300 US listed Chinese companies? Well, there are many factors, I will very briefly discuss some of the important ones. Before I begin, I should make clear that real \"penny stocks\" should be filtered out with experience, which only leaves a certain number of companies left.\\n\\n1. Market Ignorance on Growth: From the year of 2022 when TIGR is banned from doing business in mainland China, TIGR had somewhere around 50M revenue with very tiny profit (mostly just breakeven), the stock traded around 3-6 per ads/adr back then. Fast forward to 2024, in the most recent quarter, the company did 87M revenue with obvious profit, yet the stock price trades in the same range. Although I\\'m not using net revenue here, but the ratio on net revenue is similar. Also in the most recent quarter, there is a one time loss provision that had a negative non-recurring impact on earnings of that quarter, which I will discuss later. But the main point here is that the company obviously grew a lot (I used revenue/profit here just to illustrate, but we of course need to evaluate other metrics too, such as customer number, etc. I just can\\'t list them all here.), yet the stock trades in the same range without any market attention, which is great for traders if we can spot them, wait patiently, and strike when it begins to go up with strong catalysts.\\n2. Valuation: Valuation is always a big factor when trading legit companies. In case of TIGR, when it traded in the 3s, the undervaluation is pretty obvious if the company is reporting true numbers. Before it started rising, it was trading around 3.5, which is about $550M market cap. Reading the 6K from EDGAR, we know the net asset of this company is about $500M, with almost no goodwill, intangibles, etc., because it\\'s mostly a financial company. So it basically trades at its book value with almost no enterprise value. Yes it\\'s a company in the financial sector with high leverage, but still. Compare it to its most direct competitor FUTU, who had around $10B market cap at 70s (stock price), with book value of about $3.5B. Run the revenue number, FUTU does about 4 times TIGR\\'s revenue and trades about 20 times TIGR\\'s market cap. Now for profit, TIGR actually traded at an incredibly low single digit P/E if we take the one time loss provision out and the revenue/profit growth momentum continues for TIGR. If one just spend 5 minutes reading over the earnings call transcripts, it\\'d be extremely obvious that TIGR was getting better because they just had their expenses lowered due to their new clearing facilities in Hong Kong. On the other hand, FUTU always traded at least high 10th in term of P/E when it was trading in the 70s. So in a direct comparison, TIGR is extremely undervalued to FUTU. I don\\'t think I need to bring in US brokerage firms such as IBKR, Charles Schwab, or even Robinhood into comparison, it would only make the undervaluation more dramatic. So in a peer to peer comparison (but need to dig a little bit in the SEC filings and earnings), TIGR is extremely undervalued, so I assumed it would have more room to run than FUTU.\\n3. Market Hype and True Beneficiary: Market Hype is a little tricky to explain, because I did have to evaluate how much of an impact this Chinese new policy would have on the market to a certain degree. I will leave this factor out for now, just remember it\\'s important. Turning to the true beneficiaries of this wave, it\\'s very obvious that the trading volume had gone through the roof in China, in most of the Chinese markets, volume at least double or triple\\'d. As I mentioned before, people around the world can use TIGR broker to buy Hang Seng stocks (Hong Kong), since they mainly serve Mandarin or other Chinese speaking customers, they should at least be getting some very good short term boost on revenue on top of their already improving revenue right? This is probably the single most important factor that narrowed my initial picking into a group of 4 stocks only, which were: TIGR, FUTU, and LU (LU are sub lenders trading in 1-2s range, also in financial sector. I liked their valuation and stuff, but I was worried about their extreme low price per share not attracting many real/legit investors, also they were not the biggest beneficiary in comparison to brokers).\\n4. Information Mismatch: This applies to multiple aspects, the first aspect is language. When the news hit the tape, people who can read Chinese can obviously understand the changes better. However this is not the focus here, the 2nd factor is more crucial, it is more company related. TIGR trades in penny stock range (under $5), and it has not so straight forward share structure, also it\\'s a foreign company that files 6K and 20F rather than the GAAP 10Q and 10K, its financial statements can be confusing to read at times. I have talked to some people who says \"oh look TIGR has over 2b shares outstanding and have a P/E of 70 or something\" while I already gradually exited most of my positions. But in reality, if one just hit Control-F and searched \"ordinary share\" in some of their 6Ks, or 20Fs, it\\'s not hard to know that the ratio between ordinary shares and ADS/ADR is 15:1, and the true shares count for ADS is just 158m rather than over 2b. For P/E, I already mentioned before, the true P/E is in the mid-high singles. When there are so many confusing factors (which I only listed a few, but there are way more) out there plus it being a Chinese company in \"penny stock\" range, market need time to analyze and react. And in extreme cases, over confident short sellers would short too early when the share prices rises too fast, which is what I believed happened the past few days.\\n5. Preparation and Timing of the Trade: For preparation, the process is simple but highly repetitive and time consuming. I have personally spent many months and thousand of hours going through and potentially studying every ticker listed in the US market (which is almost 5k companies/stocks, skipped most obvious trash stocks/companies of course), and these obviously included all the Chinese companies listed in the US. I have a watch list of companies like TIGR with low valuation and other similar characteristics, it\\'s basically just hours of research and study. But this is not the hard part, at least not for me. The real hard part is waiting for the right time, and right time only. In my TIGR trades, if I didn\\'t get in on the very first day (9/25) or second day (since the second day is red), it\\'s highly likely that I would not like the risk/reward on the 3rd day and missed this whole trade since it\\'s moving so fast. This works both ways and in all of my other trades too. If I get in too early without waiting for catalyst, the stock usually would either drift lower or just trade within an insignificant range. If I get in too late (even just 2-3 days in most cases), the risk/reward become much worse, specially when using options with heavily increased IV and share prices.\\n\\nSo how did I execute my trades? Basically on the first day (9/25), I got shocked and not sure how to react initially. Then I quickly narrowed my picks to a group of 4 Chinese companies, TIGR, FUTU or LU, and I decided to use options because I thought this could be a pretty good asymmetrical risk/reward trade, and I only need to risk a small amount of my portfolio. Since the undervaluation for TIGR is so significant, broker being the biggest potential beneficiary, also dating back to 2020/2021, TIGR is more choppy when rising in comparison to FUTU, but it should get there eventually. LU are in low penny stock range (they are in sub lending business which I never liked in the first place, but they are in financial sector, which is positively impacted by the new policies). When stock prices are too low, the option pricing becomes very choppy, the spread is huge (at least 0.05 if I want to buy some meaningful amount). So I thought TIGR which at the time seemed to me the best choice available. This entire process of reading news and deciding to buy TIGR from the list of almost 300 Chinese stocks took me less than an hour, as I said before, although this news came as a surprise, I don\\'t really need that much time going over these stocks because I already studied them before, and they either didn\\'t move much, or drifted lower these years. The only new research I needed was to read recent filings/transcripts.\\n\\nI bought 400 of $4 TIGR call expiring Nov 15/2024 when the stock was just below 4.1 on the first day, the average for the option was slightly higher than 0.4. Which was like 80-90% of the total trading volume on that particular contract that day. My thoughts were that the hype has already seen the initial effects, give it 50 days, it could potentially benefit from the huge trading volume change, and potentially catch real investors looking for cheap China related assets.\\n\\nOn the 2nd day, US listed Chinese ETFs and almost all of Chinese ADS/ADR tanked because they overshot too much on the 1st day, rising way above what the SSE index gained in China on the 1st day. The weird thing is, FUTU actually closed green that day, while TIGR dropped 3%. That got me thinking: \"I think I\\'m wrong, people would pay high premiums for high/top quality companies, and the valuation gap would almost always be there between TIGR and FUTU.\" On this day, I bought 150 more $4 strike price TIGR contracts expiring January of 2026, they were bought at $1.15 each. My thoughts were to \"protect the losses\" of those 400 calls bought earlier. Because the company is growing, profit is going up, even without any near term boost impacts, the stock traded $5.72 for 52 weeks high, and it should at least trade somewhere near $6 some time in this more than 1 year period. Looking back at it, the trade itself wasn\\'t that bad, but clearly it was somewhat impacted by the other trade earlier, which should be avoided tbh.\\n\\nHowever on the 3rd day which got me back to my original thought and almost confirmed my thesis to a certain degree. TIGR rose 15% while FUTU gained less than 8%. I thought: \"yeah, TIGR will rise for sure, even though FUTU has the better quality here, but TIGR should eventually rise about the same amount of percentage as FUTU. Looking back at what they did back in 2020/2021, it\\'s just TIGR would be more choppy.\" Also on the 3rd day, I finally double confirmed my belief of brokers being the most beneficial group in this wave, at least initially, before any sector rotation. Because almost all of the brokers listed in China ran the most, they were all reaching their daily gain limit everyday, some rising 35%, and others rising 60-70% in the span of 3 days depending on their daily limit. But that\\'s not all, the trading volume in China was so huge that the official Shanghai Exchange had issues processing orders for 2 hours, which is unheard of! I actually stayed up late that night watching the Shanghai Index, as I feel the euphoria of the traders in public text channels in China (just like stocktwits or similar stuff). This absolutely proved that any brokers who had many Chinese related assets would benefit huge in the short term. Moreover, TIGR, FUTU or any other similar broker can put out \"surprise\" press releases saying they got a huge trading activities increase anytime, which would further fuel the rally. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, or maybe it was me just being too stupid, I never thought of going more aggressive during trading hours knowing the new information (Actually I lied, it was just me playing World of Warcraft during the entire market hour like a douchebag). After the close of that day, I saw the $6 contract expiring Nov 15/2024 going for only 0.10 on the ask! Because of the information disconnection between Chinese traders and US traders, at that time I knew I missed a huge opportunity. Indeed in the hindsight, I lost a big potential gain.\\n\\nMoving on to the 4th day, Sept 27, which is my \"hero day\", it had an early premarket high, then tanked in premarket, after it opens, it formed a double top and tanked all day. Although I just used \"pro technical words\" like double top and stuff, I think they are just non sense crap, at least in this case. Because it should move with the index, or with FUTU, if FUTU goes up, so should TIGR, which FUTU did go up that day for 5%+. In the meanwhile, I realized the huge trading volume on TIGR, also number of available shares to short were decreasing, then I realized that it must be a lot of retail shorting (specially with that double top technical crap in this case that day, without knowing shit about the fundamentals of the company). As I watched the stock tanking from 10%+ to breakeven on the day, and my options dropped even further, I knew my opportunity has finally came. I was so relieved that the market has given me the 2nd chance to correct yesterday\\'s mistakes. I sold all of my 400 $4 contracts expiring Nov 15/2024 at a over 100% gain, some of my $4 contracts expiring 2026, bought 200 of $5 contracts expiring January of 2025, then I bought 2000 (Yes 2000) of $6 expiring Nov 15/2024. My first buy on those $6s were 0.20, but as the stock drifted lower all the way to -5%, majority of my purchases were in the 0.15s. Although not as cheap as the day before, but hey, at least I got a second chance. Because of the euphoria I was seeing in the Chinese market, I added another $15k or so to complete the purchase of these 2000 $6 contracts. But due to the risky nature of options, specially this short term one, I won\\'t let my exposure get out of whack, so I mainly just put back all my previous gains from earlier options with just a little extra addition of funds. Up to this point, my buys has been complete.\\n\\nNow for my sales, since the stock rose double digits everyday for the last week, I pretty much been selling everyday, with the initial sale in the mid/low 5s for less than a dollar a contract, all the way up to low 6s when it reached high 11s or low 12s in the last trading hour on Friday. I never thought it could rise this high this fast, my original goal was more towards $7-8 near the end of this bull run. On a side note, I did make a stupid hedge later which costs me about just six figure in total. With the short borrowing fees going from 0% to 6% atm, this is a turning into a very crowded trade, last week\\'s meteoric rise involved a lot of short covers in my eyes. When trades get crowded, options become extremely expensive, there will be times where the stock goes completely insane (just anything during Covid era really), but more frequently these trades don\\'t work out in my favor, so I just completely cut them when I feel the crowdiness. Now with the entire position of 2000 $6 contracts sold, I\\'m only left with the 200+ longer term position left on my $4, $5 strikes, which I just completely hedged by shorting TIGR overnight in the high 13s (which turned out to be too early, again. Who knows if it will reach completely insane numbers like back in Covid times). I will be back to sniper mode and patiently wait for the next bull run, be it a stock on my watchlist or a sector wide hype.\\n\\nIn summary, this entire trade netted me about 1.1M in Canadian dollars. Because this is really an unexpected event to begin with, (unlike other catalysts such as earnings, at least we know the date beforehand) I\\'m quite happy with how I dealt with the situation with almost no preparation. I have uploaded some images about my account gains and some trade statements, the percentage gain is completely out of whack because I took a break from trading for couple months after a string of stupid losses. (Portfolio wise they didn\\'t hurt that much, but they were mentally frustrating) When I fund the account again with a small initial amount, the funding get calculated into gains as well. The real gaining percentage is more like 2600%-2700% rather than tens of millions.\\n\\nTo whoever wants to know a bit more about my trading style similar to what I did on this trade. I read at least 100+ books on trading and found Jessie C Stine\\'s \"Insider buy Superstocks\" and Cornwall Capital\\'s option strategies from \"The Big Shorts\" the most useful. My trading styles are very different than theirs, but I derived most of my trading methods from their general ideas. I left many hints and trails on how I would structure my trade from thought process to building a position then finally exiting in this example. It\\'s my first post on reddit, I just wrote wherever I was thinking, so the ordering or even the logic itself will be very messy or incomplete in many places, but overall this write up should roughly explain the trade in a fairly straight way.\\n\\nIn the end, I want to do a shoutout to DL12345 for encouraging me to write about this trade.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvn492g08ctd1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=872813e2f51272b47162b0305b6155172302e968\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88hwnvv08ctd1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=2794f17fee2fa27b060667e01a2bb4f96a5d1ed7\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/comggb618ctd1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c1ebc98cb6a9b3169f4afe3a11262b132a69bd9\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0al3w7g18ctd1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea0e097012276b8bc22b2d03cafdc83d00f21291'}\n",

LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\\n\\nAlthough the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.\\n\\nHere a link to the Uranium LT price: [https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price)\\n\\nThe global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!\\n\\nDuring the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.\\n\\nIn the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price\\n\\nThe official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.\\n\\n**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\\n\\n=> an average of 105 USD/lb\\n\\nWhile the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb. Today TradeTech announced a new uranium LT price of 82 USD/lb, while Cameco announces a 81.5 LT uranium price of end September 2024.\\n\\nBy consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster coming weeks with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher in coming months compared to the 81.5 USD/lb of end September 2024.\\n\\nHere is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers (look at my comment)\\n\\n**G. Russia is preparing a long list of export curbs**\\n\\nAfter the announcement of the huge (17%) cut in the planned production for 2025 and beyond of the biggest uranium producer of the world (Kazakhstan: \\\\~45% of world production), now Putin asked his people to look into the possibilities to restrict some commodities export to the Western countries, explicitely mentioning uranium\\n\\n[https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm)\\n\\n**H. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started a week ago is now accelerating (some stakeholders have been frontrunning the 2 triggers starting previous week)**\\n\\nAlthough the uranium LT price is much more important for the sector, most investors look at the uranium spotprice.\\n\\nHere a link to the uranium spotprice on Numerco: [https://numerco.com/NSet/aCNSet.html](https://numerco.com/NSet/aCNSet.html)\\n\\n**The uranium lbs available for spotselling are very scarce now, while all major uranium producers are short uranium and need to find lbs elsewhere (spot) to be able to honor their supply commitments**\\n\\nCauses:\\n\\na) Uranium One (100% production from Kazakhstan) producing less uranium than previously hoped by many (Utilities, Intermediaries, other producers). So less primary production to sell in spot\\n\\nb) Inventory X, created in 2011-2017 that solved the annual primary deficit since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted. (Confirmed by UxC)\\n\\nc) Utilities and Intermediaries increasing their minimum operational inventory levels due to the growing uranium supply insecurity => With supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\\n\\nInvestors underestimate the impact of Russian threat alone. The threat alone (without effectively going through with it) is sufficient for utilities to go from supply security to supply insecurity.\\n\\nUtilities and Intermediaries trade uranium between each other. But with supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\\n\\n**The last commercially available lbs will become unavailable before even being sold!**\\n\\n**I. Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). **Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.**\\n\\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)\\n\\nThe uranium LT price just increased to 81.50 USD/lb, while uranium spotprice started to increase the last couple of trading days of previous week.\\n\\nUranium spotprice is now at 82.63 USD/lb\\n\\nA share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at 27.60 CAD/share or 20.33 USD/sh represents an uranium price of 82.63 USD/lb\\n\\nFor instance, before the production cuts announced by Kazakhstan and before Putin's threat too restrict uranium supply to the West, Cantor Fitzgerald estimated that the uranium spotprice will reach 120 USD/lb, 130 USD/lb in 2025 and 140 USD/lb in 2026. Knowing a couple important factors in the sector today (UxC confirming that inventory X is indeed depleted now) find this estimate for 2024/2025 modest, but ok.\\n\\nAn uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \\\\~40.00 CAD/sh or \\\\~29.60 USD/sh.\\n\\nAnd with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\\n\\n**J.** **A couple uranium sector ETF's**:\\n\\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector\\n* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector\\n* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector\\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector\\n\\nI posting now, in the early days of the high season in the uranium sector that started in September and that will now hit the accelerator (Oct 1st), and not 2 months later when we will be well in the high season\\n\\n**This isn't financial advice.

As of Q2 2024, Intel’s total assets amount to approximately $182 billion, with liabilities around $91 billion, resulting in a net asset value of $91 billion. Yet, its market capitalization is around $95 billion, reflecting an almost 1:1 ratio between market cap and net assets. In contrast, competitors such as AMD and Nvidia trade at significantly higher premiums, indicating that the market may be underpricing Intel’s growth potential.\\n\\n|Company|Market Cap (Billion $)|Net Assets (Billion $)|Price to Net Asset Ratio|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Intel|95|91|1.04|\\n|AMD|266|56.5|4.71|\\n|Nvidia|3,000|58.15|51.58|\\n\\n**Understanding Intel’s Valuation**\\n\\nThe Price to Net Asset Ratio (P/NAV) is a critical measure of how the market values a company relative to its net assets. Intel's current P/NAV of 1.04 reveals that its market value is nearly identical to its net assets, a valuation that appears surprisingly low, particularly when compared to its competitors. AMD and Nvidia, for instance, demonstrate P/NAV ratios of 4.71 and 51.58, respectively. This significant gap highlights the possibility that Intel is undervalued, especially given its strong fundamentals and growth potential.\\n\\nSeveral factors support this assessment. Despite facing fierce competition, Intel remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, known for its quality and innovation. The company is making substantial investments in new technologies and manufacturing capabilities, positioning itself to capitalize on growing trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\\n\\nAdditionally, Intel boasts a robust balance sheet, with total assets of about $182 billion and liabilities around $91 billion. This financial strength provides a solid foundation for future growth and strategic initiatives. Although the recent decision to lay off 15,000 employees might seem concerning, it is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and focus on core competencies, enabling Intel to adapt more effectively to evolving market demands.\\n\\nA key factor influencing Intel's future is the increasing global demand for semiconductors. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the need for high-performance chips continues to rise. Intel's resources and commitment to innovation position it to capture a larger share of this expanding market.\\n\\nMoreover, government support for the semiconductor industry adds another layer of potential upside for Intel. Given the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing in light of global supply chain challenges, particularly concerning the Taiwan-China situation, there is growing interest from government entities to bolster domestic semiconductor production. This focus on strengthening local supply chains can create favorable conditions for Intel, as it could receive both financial incentives and regulatory support to expand its operations and enhance its competitive positioning.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn summary, Intel Corporation is significantly undervalued based on its current P/NAV ratio. The company possesses strong assets, a history of innovation, and a strategic focus on future technologies. As Intel continues to execute its strategic plans and navigate market challenges, it has substantial potential to regain its competitive edge and achieve remarkable growth. Furthermore, the increasing government interest in supporting semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical uncertainties enhances Intel's prospects. The market's current valuation does not adequately reflect Intel's true value and growth potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity.\\n\\n\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:\\n\\nThis post was summarized by ChatGPT to correct language and summarize, the original paper was written exclusively by myself.\"}\n",

What’s the current state of Bitcoin miners?', 'score': 0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fz3pai/is_it_time_to_board_the_bitcoin_hype_train_whats/', 'num_comments': 84, 'created': 1728404149.0, 'body': 'Disclaimer:\\n\\nI own MARA based on my prediction and MSTR based on it’s institutional support. What I have listed below is for the purpose of discussion and not financial advice. Ideally I get to hear some solid opinions on the matter, which is the reason for this post.\\n\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nThe much anticipated Bitcoin „Uptober“ has arguably been less explosive than expected. Maybe it was already priced in due to Bitcoins performance in September (usually a red month but not this year). Maybe Bitcoin just needs to warm up after its heavy consolidation period. Maybe there are other stakes at play for the delayed boom… Nevertheless, Bitcoin seems to finally be gaining some momentum, and Bitcoin related stocks like MSTR are starting to move (+70% in in the last 30 days), showing a growing market interest in the sector.\\n\\nBitcoin and Mining stocks: \\n\\nI don’t think a lot needs to be said about MSTR. Michael Saylors vision of MSTR is clear as he keeps buying and promoting Bitcoin. I believe MSTR will be a standard play for a lot of institutions this cycle, as seen with its current move to the upside.\\n\\nOn to the more controversial topic of crypto miners like MARA and RIOT:\\n\\nThese stocks have been friends of mine in the past. For one, their market caps are relatively low, making them quite volatile during hype periods. On top of that, they are shorted against, creating massive opportunities for short squeezes (I don’t think I need to explain to y’all the possible upsides of that…).\\n\\nHowever, one point that keeps getting brought up is that many of these companies will dilute their shares (sell extra shares) to raise more cash, which in turn decreases the underlying share value of shareholders. Although I agree that this isn’t ideal, I think it is important to mention that this is mainly done to buy more Bitcoin before possible major Bitcoin moves (as MARA and MSTR do). So whether this makes you a fan or a hater of the stock is up to you really. But I believe that if someone is going to buy into a Bitcoin stocks purely for the boom, then this should be seen as bullish because in my opinion, a company holding more Bitcoin will be more attractive to other investors. \\n\\nSo yea, Bitcoin miners are a rollercoaster. But can’t that be advantageous?\\n\\nPossibly relevant timestamps:\\n\\nI know I know… past crypto cycles are not recipes for future cycles. But the cycles have retreated several times of bitcoins lifetime, hence my short summary below. \\n\\n1. October 2024: \\n\\nAs explained, October generally is the best performing month (historically speaking) for Bitcoin throughout the whole year. November and December are also very profitable months, and the rally tends to extend past this. During this time, larger Bitcoin related stocks MSTR also perform very well. \\n\\nIn the last cycle 4 years ago, MSTR grew 166% from October 1st to December 31st. Its rally topped out early February the following year with a return of over 800%… \\n\\nBitcoin miner MARA grew 450% from October 1st to December 31st. Its rally topped out mid Feb the following year with a return of over 2500%. RIOT performed similarly.\\n\\n2. December 2024\\n\\nThis upcoming December, the implementation phase of MiCAR (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) is set to end. It will be followed by an 18 month transitional period, in which all entities providing crypto asset services much be compliant with international regulations. This will improve the image Bitcoin and crypto in terms of regulatory safety, and the effects can already be seen with major institutional involvement. Whether it becomes a short term catalyst is to be seen, but for Bitcoin HODLers, this is essential.\\n\\n3. 2025 and onward \\n\\nObviously, it is very likely that the Bitcoin hypetrain will be followed by another crypto winter. In the last cycle, stocks like MSTR saw this winter following its peak early Feb. RIOT faced a similar trend. MARA, on the other hand, settled at a new ATH in early April 2021 (+5000% from October 2020), and topped out even further the following November 2021 (+7500% from October 2020). Based on historical data, it can be argued that Bitcoin and Bitcoin related stocks will see further and major upside in 2025.\\n\\nPrediction:\\n\\nSo what is my non-professional and totally degenerate expectation of Bitcoin related stocks?\\n\\nFirst off, I think that all stocks with major holdings in Bitcoin will do well in the early stages of the cycle. So this would be the likes of MSTR. I also believe that miners will continue to lag behind at first, but will eventually catch up and even outperform Bitcoin and larger Bitcoin stocks, simply because of their lower market caps. In terms of when I expect the top to occur, it is hard to say… I will definitely be eyeing December as a first milestone. If it feels like the MiCAR regulations were a catalyst for Bitcoin, it could be that Bitcoin slows in Jan and Feb. Next I will be watching end of January and early Feb, as this clearly was a major timestamp in last years cycle. Following February I expect some cooling and a bit of selling. In the beginning and throughout next summer, I will pay attention to how momentum is moving Bitcoin stocks and potentially swing trade. I will be looking for Bitcoin stocks which implement a HODL strategy.\\n\\nSadly, I don’t think we will reach the percentage gains that we did in the last cycle. Another gain of 7500% for MARA would but it at over $1100 per share. Although I would be ecstatic about this, I just don’t see it as realistic…\\n\\nClosing words\\n\\nLet me know what you think. This isn’t some ChatGPT summary to pump the stock. This one was ✨handwritten with love✨. I’m open for discussion on the matter and would appreciate any solid input.'}\n",

For most investors (including myself), it’s difficult to part with winners. Not only that, I am someone who believes AI will proliferate throughout society in the coming years. Because they design data center GPUs, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries as the AI boom continues. It might seem counter-intuitive then to sell the stock here, but that is what I’ve begun doing over the past two weeks.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1mrdxxmcsetd1.jpg?width=1582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99dacab7094cfcdf83b92c7aeb6bccb4cb712d0b\\n\\nI had high hopes for AMD this year, but it’s my view that they've failed to take significant data center GPU market share from Nvidia, and will have increased competition from Intel's new product offerings (on both\\xa0[client](https://youtu.be/QB1u4mjpBQI?si=aO3PiV0MPfbaneGQ)\\xa0and\\xa0[data center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h0wBn2L-FU)), as well as\\xa0[proprietary silicon](https://aws.amazon.com/silicon-innovation/)\\xa0from large cloud players (Google, Amazon, etc). My original thesis was that AMD would profit from overextended Nvidia margins in 2024, but this underestimated the CUDA ecosystem moat that existed with Nvidia data center products (see\\xa0[Why I Got Nvidia Wrong](https://dragdeninvest.substack.com/p/why-i-got-nvidia-wrong)). While most large cloud players want to diversify at least somewhat from Nvidia, they are still unable to do so without risking a competitive advantage with their own AI offerings. Add Intel into the mix, and the margin and market share pressure will be on AMD. The only player in the silicon value chain I think which can currently raise margins is TSMC ([TSM\\xa02.61%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/TSM)), but the geopolitical risk is too high for me to continue holding the stock (I sold my TSMC stake two weeks ago).\\n\\nOn the PC (personal computer), Nvidia has always had a strong moat. It’s not just because they have the best performing products, but also because game developers are economically incentivized to optimize first (and often only) for the largest potential audience. This is similar to the moat CUDA protects on the data center side. One might think that Nvidia charging incredibly high prices for discrete graphics cards would cause them to lose share to AMD with consumers who directly purchase the products (as opposed to businesses who purchase the data center products). Yet Nvidia market share has only grown over the past few years.\\n\\n[Data from Jon Peddie Research](https://preview.redd.it/pzxm2k1rretd1.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cfd356470b25dcb69704c34739bd6cbb61798e0)\\n\\n**Why This Take Could Be Wrong:**  \\nThere is a lot of bullish momentum in the investor community around AMD currently from both professional commentators and retail investors (e.g. Twitter / X). Many people who had never heard of AMD 5 years ago are now saying to put money into the stock as it is Nvidia’s only pure AI competitor. As a result of this, AMD could see a dramatic rise on a positive earnings report later this month. In addition, I expect gaming revenues to surprise to the upside with the minor refresh of Xbox and Playstation consoles coming for holiday season. I still have \\\\~260 shares of AMD remaining, and will likely hold to see if the stock jumps on the report. I think that AMD is extremely stretched in its current valuation (P/E of 205), and that any bad news could send it spiralling. Selling half of the remaining stake now is essentially a hedge against this possibility. Whatever happens with the earnings report, I will likely reduce my AMD holdings to zero in the next few months as I continue to lower exposure to companies\\xa0[reliant on Taiwan](https://substack.com/@dragdeninvest/p-138866297).\"}\n",

It’s a stupid idea built on fantasies.  Here’s my argument:\\n\\n1. Every single Tesla owner I know won’t lend out their cars. The lending out is the stupidest idea ever.  Every car owner I know won\\'t lend out their car either.  Tesla will have to run their own fleet which will increase costs, maintenance etc.\\n2. Percentage of people willing to take a robotaxi daily are low; like Uber.  At best; it’s will be an Uber like service with limited use cases:  Traveling, airports, designated drivers etc.\\n3. Costs are astronomical when you add up all your small daily trips.  Two kids household in the US suburbs with limited public transportation.  I take approximately 8-10 roundtrips a day, sometimes more on the weekends.\\n\\nFor example: $7 per trip according to Musk: commute(2), kids school(2), kids activities(2-4), leisure or Starbucks or McDonald’s or family visits(2). $60-80 per day= $1500+ per month and that’s assuming every trip is $7.  Why not just own a car at    that price?\\n\\nEdit: I forgot to add the emotional, pride and freedom of owning a car.  US consumers love their cars and trucks more so than guns.  A lot of people will die rather than give up their cars.\\n\\nEdit: All the pro responses are parroting the same spiel that Musk, Woods and analysts are spewing.  No examples, no numbers, no market.  It\\'s \"Believe me, it will happen\".  Same as the metaverse, Vision Pro, 3D printing, 3D TV which were all touted as the next big thing but ended being a limited market.\\n\\nTheir car and energy businesses will be fine but the trillions robotaxi business has always been a fantasy.

Really dedicated myself to learning the markets. Most importantly, I've made good progress mastering my emotions. I've even gone on months without masturbating.

I will get back to $1M. I'm just here to prove to the world and myself that this isn't over.\\n\\nIs it the most hedged / low risk decision? Fuck no. The degen surely lives on inside me.

The focus is now on the success of the drug and it’s roll out if approved.  \\n  \\n**What the FUDsters spew**  \\n  \\n- The bears will continue to point to “manipulated” data by Dr Wang and how supposedly crooked Barbier is. Up to this point, that has just proven to be accusations and nothing concrete has been proven.  \\n  \\n- The amount of hit pieces and trolls on internet forums tells you all you need to know. If it truly was a scam, why even bother with the hit pieces. It will fail on it’s merits.  \\n  \\n- Every time positive data has been released, subsequently there is a short attack mixed with a FUD article that is released. This is clear manipulation and coordination by the powers that be.  \\n  \\nIMO, there is too much to gain or lose on this stock, and therefore there is a battle right now on the narrative of the company. The FDA had continued to allow SAVA to keep their trials going(despite challenges from the FUDsters to shut them down) and the company has done their best to remain quiet about the FUD. We will know in about 8 weeks who is right, and who is wrong. Time to place your bets.'}\n",

As Intel will likely underperform until their longterm goals pay off I believe the stock will continue to fall unless there is good news like alot of Gaudi3 sales/preorders. Gaudi 3 is lower performance than Nvidias newest ai chip though.\\n\\nLong term-\\n\\nEverything Intel is doing are long term investments that will only pay off 2-5 yrs from now. Building fab projected to take 2 yrs, 18A architecture 1 yr to begin production but will require another year for mass production,14A 3 yrs. These projects has high risk of being delayed.\\n\\nShort term-\\n\\nOn the short term, great news that has yet to happen is Intel showing progress on using their new High NA EUV Lithography machine, improving issues like low output. This machine is more advanced than what TSMC has and is the one lead intel has over TSMC.\\n\\nThe best news possible in the short term for Intel would be TSMC being attacked by China. This would easily lead to Intel tripling in value as TSMC's main operations are landlocked in [Taiwan.Global](http://Taiwan.Global) Guardian experts put the likelihood of an all-out invasion at around 35%. Smaller scale escalations like interupting Taiwans trade will also greatly improve nana's position. Chinese military are already being accused of intentionally ramming into Philippine ships.\\n\\nLong term potential could be Astronomical if Intel succeeds in their reversal but competitors are also improving. Nvidia's Ai Chips for example are improving at a faster rate than Intel, making them unlikely to catch up in that area. However, their head start on the High NA EUV machine could make it possible to jump the gap against Nvidia. Tesla already thinking of ordering thousands of Nvidia's next gen AI chip set for 2025/26, Intel still has a very strong balance sheet with a large amount of equity, but debt is increasing at an alarming rate and there's rumors intel accounting methods are made to favor their books.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lf5ndqyrpvsd1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=69e644a13a0e590bb3d76907a5dba8fed5d39f2f\"}\n",

This is all conjecture with no dd done to even confirm my assumptions and I'm somewhat of a tard. Also I've been in the housing market for about 4 years and have been wrong every step of the way so maybe there's a bit of wishful thinking.\\n\\nYet I'm convinced that the housing market is about to correct. Hard.\\n\\n1. We all remember 2021 and the absolute buying spree caused by the record low interest rates. And with interest rates starting to be lowered most analysts expect housing sales to start back picking up. But for one I think that the record low rates of 2021- 2023 caused a pull forward effect of purchasing activity. These really were all time low rates and everyone with means we're buying and bidding prices up. Now I think the buyers and bidders that remain will be less likely to pay the prices that sellers are asking. Housing asking prices remain high in what is a very different market than just 2 years ago which will cause supply to increase.\\n\\n2. Despite the fact that rates were recently cut I think potential buyers who were unable to buy during the pandemic and are now reentering the market will do so more cautiously anticipating continued rate cuts. Instead of jumping in and buying as the market expects, and possibly refinancing constantly on the way down, I think that those historic lows will cause a lot of buyers to wait for more cuts or price drops before committing. This potential dampened demand will cause a negative feedback loop with buyers continuing to wait to see if conditions worsen.\\n\\n3. While inventory has remained low which is often cited for continued upward price pressure i think that we may soon see a supply spike. This part is anecdotal but I have heard from some potential sellers of both single family homes and condos who held off on listing their property during the first half of the year in anticipation of rate cuts. Some of these sellers are investors who could find themselves overextended in a cooling economy who were holding out for this point were rates are cut. Now that it has arrived they may soon start listing but due to the previous 2 reasons may not find the buyers they were expecting.\\n\\n4. Return to office mandates will also be a factor especially in the previous hot markets outside of major cities. So some of the places that saw wfh people flood into town looking for yard space or extra rooms for home offices will now need to move back in closer proximity to cities which could further increase supply in certain regions. \\n\\nEither way that's all I have today. I know ever millennial still living with their granny have hoped for this to happen at some point which is exactly why it didn't but maybe this time is different. The housing market is about to correct. \\nHappy hunting!\"}\n",

Let me break it down for you: Domino’s (DPZ) is about to make a major move, and I’m all in on calls. Here’s why:\\n\\n\\t1.\\tDomino’s Is the New Tech Stock: Forget software, AI, and semiconductors – Domino’s has become the delivery platform of the future. With their investment in delivery tech (self-driving cars, drone deliveries, AI-enhanced kitchens), they’ve quietly become a logistics powerhouse. They’re not selling pizza anymore, they’re selling infrastructure. Who’s going to compete? Uber Eats? LOL.\\n\\t2.\\tEveryone’s Broke, Everyone’s Ordering Pizza: Economic downturn? Who cares. When people get laid off, they’re not fine dining – they’re getting Domino’s two-for-$6.99 deals. Domino’s thrives in both bull and bear markets. If the economy tanks, pizza demand soars. If the economy booms, pizza is still a staple. Heads we win, tails we win.\\n\\t3.\\tShort Interest and Bear Sentiment: DPZ is undervalued right now because the bears are too fixated on labor costs and inflation, but here’s the thing – the margin squeeze is temporary. Domino’s has an ace up their sleeve: they’ve been raising prices sneakily through new fees, and consumers haven’t blinked. Inflation’s peaked. Watch those margins skyrocket again.\\n\\t4.\\tInstitutions Are Sleeping on DPZ: These clowns are sleeping while Domino’s keeps expanding internationally. Delivery demand is exploding in Europe and Asia, and Domino’s is one of the few Western brands already set up to dominate. Global domination incoming, and nobody’s pricing this in.\\n\\t5.\\tEarnings Beat Incoming: Mark my words: Domino’s is about to crush expectations in the next earnings report. They’ve been aggressively cost-cutting, plus their digital app growth is through the roof. You heard it here first – next earnings call, DPZ prints.\\n\\nConclusion: Stop throwing your money at meme stocks with no revenue and start looking at DPZ. I’m loading up on October  calls. You’re either riding this pizza rocket with me, or you’re stuck bag-holding the rest of 2024.\\n\\nTL;DR: Domino’s is the next Amazon of pizza logistics. Calls are about to print, and the bears are in for a rude awakening. Get in before the moon mission.'}\n",

National retail price of regular gasolein and diesel fell on weekly basis and are lower compared to a year before.\\n*Transport consumes 60% of crude oil in form of refined products like gasoil and gasoline.\\n\\n#2 China gave significant stimulus to the economy by cutting lending rates and providing incentives to home buyers etc. Hang Seng index jumped some 25% in a week. But impact of policy changes [while reflected immediately in financial products & sectors] takes sometime to impact manufacturing, services and retail activities. China has been lagging behind in energy imports and consumption in 2024: massive sales of EV vehicles and switch to LNG for truckers are cited as major reasons, besides sluggish economy.\\n\\n#3 Germany's Q2 GDP report [released on 27th August] indicated -0.1% growth rate. Another quarter of such anemic growth and Germany will be under technical recession.\\n\\n#4 OPEC+ spare capacity: OPEC+ has imposed production cuts [5.7 million barrels per day] and given up market share to defend international crude oil prices. This strategy has largely not worked. \\nOPEC+ will start roll back of production cut from December 2024 @ 180,000 barrels per day every month and eventually raise output by 2.16 million barrels per day in 20 months.\\nIn August, Saudi Arabia pumped 8.9 million barrels per day out of maximum output capacity of 12 million barrels per day. But being a low cost producer [Saudi production cost is estimated at 25$ per barrel vs 65$ for US shale producers & 70$ for UK's off shore North Sea producers], it may chose to ramp up production to make the money [in volume if not in margins] to balance it budgets.\\n\\n#5 Non OPEC producers: Non Opec producers like USA, Canada, Brazil, and Guyana are increasing production and thus making OPEC+ production cut strategy ineffective. \\n\\nSOME ENERGY RELATED FACTS:\\n\\nUS is the largest producer [13 million barrels per day] and consumer [18 million barrels per day] of crude oil \\n\\nChina is the second largest consumer [16 million barrels per day] and largest importer [12 million barrels per day] of crude oil\\n\\nIndia consumes 5 million barrels per day\\n\\nGermany consumes 2 million barrels per day\\n\\nOPEC+ produces almost 35% of global crude oil production \\n\\nISRAEL-IRAN\\n\\nTel Aviv-Tehran have exchanged blows [directly and indirectly] more than once in 2024. But it is not unreasonable to assume that a full-fledged war is not on the card.\\n\\nIsrael yesterday has threatened an attack on Iranian oil & gas infrastructure [Iran crude oil export stands at 3 million barrels per day]. \\n\\nIndeed, an attack on Iranian oil & gas infrastructure would roil energy markets. \\n\\nBut in terms of geopolitical calculus, Israel has little benefit in taking such an action:\\n\\nA) It is dismantling terror infrastructure of Hezbollah and Hamaz rather successfully\\n\\nB) High energy prices are detrimental to the US economy [Israel's main security partner]\\n\\nC) This provocative action may cost the goodwill of non NATO countries like Japan, India, South Africa etc.\\n\\nD) It would consitute an escalation and may force Iran to take even more drastic action that may compromise safety of Israeli civilians and military forces\\n\\nLIKELY FUTURE COURSE\\n\\nIsrael will not attack Iranian nuclear, and oil & gas infrastructure. \\n\\nEnergy markets are likely to stay elevated till Israel retaliates [may be as early as this weekend] \\n\\nBut once some semblence of calm in Middle East is established, energy price will begin a gentle slide down [along with the price of energy stocks]\\n\\nHOW TO TRADE\\n\\nTime frame: 90 days\\n\\nInstrument: PUT Option \\n\\nUnderlying: Crude Oil [Brent/WTI], Gasoil, & US energy company stocks\"}\n",

The company has been recognized for its ability to deliver enterprise AI solutions at scale, which has been a key differentiator in the market. Recent strategic partnerships and expansions, such as those with Tampa General and Panasonic Energy, highlight its focus on leveraging AI to enhance operational efficiencies. Additionally, Palantir's inclusion in the S&P 500 index and its strategic moves in AI and defense sectors have positively impacted its market perception.\\n\\n# Fundamental Analysis\\n\\n* **Revenue and Profitability**: Palantir reported a 27% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 2024, with total revenue reaching $678 million. The U.S. commercial sector saw a 55% increase, while the government sector grew by 23%. The company achieved a GAAP net income of $134 million, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of profitability. This growth is attributed to strong demand for AI-driven solutions and strategic commercial contracts, although revenue from these contracts is expected to decline. ✅\\n* **Strategic Positioning**: Palantir is heavily investing in AI and enterprise solutions, with a focus on transitioning from prototype to production. Its strategic partnerships and product innovations, such as the AIP and Warp Speed initiatives, align with its goal to dominate the AI and defense sectors. These efforts are expected to drive long-term growth and strengthen its competitive position. ✅\\n* **Risks**: Key risks include competitive pressures in the AI sector, potential regulatory challenges, and geopolitical tensions, particularly in regions like the Middle East. These factors could impact Palantir's ability to maintain its growth trajectory and profitability. \\n\\n# Technical Analysis\\n\\n* **Price Movements**: Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility, with a recent surge to a 52-week high of $39.29. The stock has shown strong upward momentum, reflecting positive market sentiment.\\n* **Key Indicators**: The RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential for a price correction. The MACD shows a bullish trend, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating strong momentum. ✅\\n* **Support and Resistance Levels**: Key support is around $30, with resistance at the recent high of $39.29. These levels suggest potential entry and exit points for traders.\\n\\n# Investment Recommendation\\n\\n* **Valuation Insights**: With a trailing P/E ratio of 230.82 and a forward P/E of 91.26, Palantir appears overvalued compared to industry peers. However, its strong growth prospects and strategic positioning in AI may justify a premium valuation. ⚠️\\n* **Short-term Outlook**: Given the current momentum and market conditions, Palantir is expected to continue its upward trend in the short term. Short-term investors might consider a buy, but should be cautious of potential volatility. ✅\\n* **Long-term Outlook**: Palantir's investments in AI and strategic partnerships position it well for long-term growth. However, investors should be mindful of the risks associated with geopolitical tensions and market competition. Overall, it is a\\xa0**hold**\\xa0for long-term investors. ✅\\n* **Final Recommendation**: Considering both the fundamental and technical analysis, Palantir is a\\xa0**hold**. While it has strong growth potential, the current valuation and market risks suggest caution. ⚠️\"}\n",

Manufacturing activity, as of September, has been in contraction since April 2023, bar three months. Exacerbating the outlook are US efforts to cut China off from supplies of advanced semiconductors and other technologies set to drive future economic growth — an approach that officials in Washington call “strategic competition” and China decries as “containment.” Confidence at home became so fragile that China’s bank loans to the real economy shrank this summer for the first time in 19 years. The balance sheets of cash-strapped local governments, which are already laden with hidden debt, are among the casualties of slumping property prices. Their revenue from land sales has been declining at a record clip, making it harder to reverse a drop in budget expenditure just when economy is in dire need of fiscal support.\\n\\n> Optimism was high as China exited pandemic curbs in late 2022 and reopened its borders that the nation would see a rapid recovery in consumer spending fueled by “revenge shopping,” eating out and travel. That boost failed to materialize as people fretted about what weak growth means for unemployment and incomes. The years-long real estate crisis also wiped out an estimated $18 trillion in wealth from households, prompting people to save rather than spend and pushing China into its longest streak of deflation since 1999. Chinese consumption edged up slightly during a major holiday in September, adding to signs the rebound in spending by households still had a way to go. \\n\\n> Unemployment remains a concern, made worse by a regulatory crackdown on big technology companies that deprived many young, ambitious graduates of a lucrative career path. The youth jobless rate rose in August for the second straight month to its highest level this year.\\n\\n> Real estate has been the main engine of China’s economic growth since President Xi Jinping came to office a decade ago. The government attempted to crack down on heavily indebted developers in 2020 to reduce risks to the financial system. That pushed house prices down and many weaker companies defaulted. Many developers stopped building homes they had already sold but hadn’t yet delivered, prompting some people to stop paying their mortgages. This turbulence was a wakeup call for many Chinese, who have long considered property a sure-bet investment and used it as a store of wealth. The pain continued into 2024, extending a trend of declines in place since early 2022. In May, China unveiled its most far-reaching attempt to revive the property market. But progress has been slow on plans that include a program to provide 300 billion yuan ($43 billion) of central bank funding to help government-backed firms buy unsold homes from developers. And given the unattractive economics of the plan for local authorities, only a fraction of more than 200 cities urged to participate by the central government are heeding the call to help absorb an excess of housing. \\n\\ntldr; young generation fukt, no consumers, deflation, housing/housing banking rekt\\n'}\n",
