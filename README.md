# data_scraping
This project involves scraping data from the Reddit subreddit "wallstreetbets" using the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library. The data is then cleaned and saved into a CSV file for further analysis.
# Dependencies
To run the code, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

tweepy, pandas, praw, re (part of Python's standard library). You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install tweepy pandas praw
# API Credentials
To access Reddit's API, you need to have a Reddit account and create an application to obtain the following credentials:

client_id, client_secret. user_agent.
These credentials should be inserted into the code where the PRAW Reddit instance is created.

# Running the Code
Scraping Data:

The code scrapes the top 500 posts from the "wallstreetbets" subreddit.
The scraped data includes the post title, score, URL, number of comments, creation time, and body text.
The data is printed to the console and saved to a CSV file named reddit_posts.csv.
Cleaning Data:

The body text of each post is cleaned by converting it to lowercase, removing URLs, and removing special characters.
The cleaned data is displayed in the console.
# Execution
To execute the code, run the Jupyter notebook or convert the notebook to a Python script and run it using:

python script_name.py
# Future Improvements
Integrating Data from Multiple Sources:

Consider integrating data from other financial news sources or APIs to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
Use additional data sources like stock market data to correlate Reddit discussions with market movements.
Advanced Sentiment Analysis:

Implement more advanced sentiment analysis techniques using libraries like nltk, TextBlob, or VADER to analyze the sentiment of the posts.
Consider using machine learning models for sentiment analysis to improve accuracy.
Data Visualization:

Add data visualization to better understand trends and patterns in the data.
Use libraries like matplotlib or seaborn for creating visualizations.
Real-time Data Processing:

Implement real-time data processing to continuously monitor and analyze new posts as they are published.
Scalability:

Consider using cloud services or distributed computing frameworks to handle larger datasets and improve processing speed.
